138665,question,,"As most of the above answers state, Mohs micrographic surgery for skin cancer means by DEFINITION, the Mohs surgeon is also the pathologist reading slides for THAT particular skin cancer surgery case. The reason for this is that the surgeon knows best the orientation and location of the tissue, and the quality of the surrounding skin on the patient, for the best &quot;clinicopathologic&quot; correlation of what is under the microscope, to what is going on with the patient.A properly, officially fellowship-trained Mohs surgeon is equally, and likely MORE, qualified to read the tissue because we have training in the reading of frozen sections that are oriented horizontally in the Mohs fashion, rather than the &quot;bread-loafing&quot; slices traditionally done with permanent section pathology reading. This gives a more complete 100% view of the tissue borders, rather than sample sections.A surgeon who says that a separate pathologist is on site reading slides... is NOT performing legal Mohs surgery. The surgeon may perform the removal, and have a pathologist read the slides, but may NOT bill the removal as a &quot;Mohs layer&quot;.

2961572,question,,"Both standard excision and Mohs excision are methods used to remove skin cancers. In Mohs surgery the pathology is done while you wait. In standard excision the pathology is done over a few days to a week.Mohs pathology examines more of the margin and thus allows a narrower excision to be checked with high fidelity - ideal in places like the nose or eyelid. Also because the pathology is clear more complex stitching can be done more comfortably the same day, knowing that a positive margin won't come back a few days later.In less sensitive areas where there is more loose skin and relatively straightforward sewing can be done, the advantages of Mohs surgery over traditional excision is reduced significantly. A 2-3mm difference in the cancer removal specimen may be very important in the nose but much less important on the arm for example where in either case the wound would be stitched with a straight line for example. Similarly the difference in cure rates between the two approaches is much less for small superficial lesions on the body or arms.Other treatment options can be used for small superficial lesions.The relative value of each procedure is increasingly being determined by insurance coverage and to insure that Mohs surgery is used primarily in places where it is more beneficial, a series of appropriate use criteria were developed and are used by a number of insurance carriers to determine eligibility for Mohs.

	You should ask your surgeon how he or she will be protecting the eye and performing the procedure.

This protects the eye while surgery is being performed. It is easily inserted and removed. The best that you can do is talk to the surgeon performing the Mohs surgery.

	The benefits of Mohs surgery include a lower rate of recurrence of the tumor (ie, the chances of&nbsp;the cancer&nbsp;ever coming back are lower with Mohs than&nbsp;any other procedure)&nbsp;and a more targeted removal of the tumor (only cancerous tissue is removed, sparing healthy tissue).&nbsp;

	Mohs is recommended for the shoulder if the size is greater than 2.0cm, if you have any immune suppression, if the tumor is more aggressive than usual, or if you are young (under 40 years of age), for example.&nbsp; Seeing a fellowship trained Mohs surgeon (a member of the American College of Mohs Surgery) is advised.&nbsp;

	Mohs micrographic surgery provides the highest cure rate for skin cancer while preserving the greatest amount of surrounding normal healthy tissue.

	My recommendation is to have your surgery performed by a Mohs surgeon who has completed a fellowship in Mohs surgery after their dermatology residency (i.e. a member or fellow of the American College of Mohs Surgery). The fellowship includes additional training in Mohs surgery, dermatopathology (interpretation of glass slides) and reconstruction.

	It is impossible to say how many stages to expect. The point with Mohs surgery is that we start with the smallest surgical margin possible and then trace out the roots of the skin cancer. So if your skin cancer is very small, it will only be one or two stages. If your skin cancer is larger, then it could be additional stages. No guessing...only take a small rim of tissue and then examine the surgical margins.

	Anesthesia is usually by local anesthesia since we don't know how many stages will be required. Talk to your surgeon about your concerns regarding anesthesia and he/she can try to make you as comfortable as possible. Good luck.

Traditional excision involves taking a 0.5 cm to 1 cm margin (depending on the location and pathology). Then examining the pathology margins, often in a delayed fashion. Mohs surgery takes a minimal amount of tissue from around the lesion and is then examined instantaneously by a special pathology process to see where there is residual tumor. It is then excised, and the process repeated until there is no more tumor. Mohs minimizes the amount of normal tissue taken and is generally used in tissue-sensitive areas such as the face, ears, nose, eyelids, scalp. It is not uncommon for insurance companies to insist on traditional excision on the extremities and torso because there is generally enough skin to close the larger excision.

	Mohs surgery, named after&nbsp;Dr. Frederic Mohs who is its innovator, &nbsp;is the most effective treatment for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the nose. Studies have shown that these neoplasms have a higher chance of recurring in this location as well as when they are located on the ears, temples, lips and a few other areas. Mohs surgery is indicated because of the location, but also for tissue conservation (produce the smallest hole possible), with the highest chance of cure by examining, not a representative margin, but 100% of the margin. Reconstruction is often done after the Mohs surgery to produce the best functional and aesthetic outcome.

	If the Mohs surgery location on your nose is in the concave part on the side just above your nostril, this is an excellent location for healing by itself (also known as healing by secondary intention, or granulation). Your Mohs surgeon or plastic surgeon should evaluate whether letting the wound heal this way might cause collapse of the nostril when you try to breathe in through your nose. If there is no risk of collapse, and you don&#39;t feel like more surgery, I think allowing it to heal is a fine option, as long as you understand it can take longer and still requires wound care until healed.

	Without a doubt Mohs micrographic surgery offers the best treatment for a skin cancer. Using a meticulous surgical and microscopic technique, a Mohs surgeon removes the cancer and spares healthy tissue around it. Given lower risk of recurrence and lack of incomplete excision, Mohs surgery is also the most cost effective treatment. As far as reconstruction of a cosmetically sensitive area is concerned, look for a Mohs surgeon with experience in such reconstructions. For example, a&nbsp;fellowship-trained Mohs surgeons spend an extra year perfecting&nbsp;Mohs technique and reconstructive surgery. Ask to see before and after photos if you still have any doubts. Or, if a defect is very challenging, i.e. involving bone, then a multi-specialty approach involving plastic surgeons, ENT, or oculoplastic surgeon may be necessary.

	Mohs surgery requires that one person act as both surgeon and pathologist and that the tissue is mapped and processed so that virtually 100% of the periperal and deep surgical margins are viewed microscopically.

	Frozen section removal by a plastic surgeon would suggest that the tissue is sent off and processed and read by another specialist, probably a pathologist. How the tissue is processed is also critical. Some laboratories will cut vertically through the tissue, a process called breadloafing in that it resembles slices in a loaf of bread. Some may perform a more meticulous evaluation of the surgical margins. So you need to check and see how the tissue would be processed.

	Mohs surgery has a 98.5-99% cure rate for previously untreated basal cell carcinoma according to the scientific literature. I am unaware of similar studies that look at frozen section surgery (in part because of the differences in how the tissue is processed by various laboratories).

	The American College of Mohs Surgery recommends that you see a Mohs surgeon that has completed a 1-2 year fellowship in Mohs surgery and is a member or fellow of that College. That assures that the doctor performing the Mohs surgery has spent additional training after residency learning the Mohs procedure, interpretation of the slides and performing the necessary reconstruction. Good luck.

	When you have a basal cell carcinoma on the nose especially one that is morpheaform. I would mostly advocate for Mohs surgery unless you are a poor surgical candidate. Here are the reasons why: 1. Radiation therapy can cause DNA damage and result in more skin cancers down the line. If you were 100 years old that might not be an issue but if you plan to live another 20+ years then that is an important thing to consider is that you may develop additional cancers in the radiation field. 2. Morpheaform basal cells are aggressive and Mohs surgery is the gold standard to treat them. You want to do the procedure that has the best cure rate the first time around, if this recurs, it can turn into a much larger procedure. &nbsp;3. Mohs surgery is less time intensive and more cost effective than radiation therapy.

	&nbsp;

	As far as scarring, yes you would have a scar from Mohs surgery, regardless of who does the reconstruction. Fellowship trained Mohs surgeons who belong to the American College of Mohs surgery are trained in the reconstruction aspect and perform more facial reconstruction for skin cancer defects than any other specialty, including plastic surgery.&nbsp;

	There are many reasons that a skin cancer might be treated by Mohs surgery. The most common indications include location (e.g. eyelids, lips, nose, ears), aggressive types of skin cancer, poorly defined clinical margins, involvement of the surgical margins, large skin cancers (e.g. &gt; 1 cm on the face or &gt; 2cm on the trunk and extremities), perineural invovlement (i.e. tumor wrapped around the nerve). Since they&#39;re recommending Mohs after the skin cancer was excised (according to your question), I&#39;m assuming the surgical margins could be involved, but the best option is to ask the doctor specifically why he or she is recommending Mohs surgery for your skin cancer. There could be other reasons as well. Regarding cost, that is something that you would have to discuss with the surgeon. Costs might vary. Best bet, in my opinion, is to see a member of the American College of Mohs Surgery. These individuals have completed an additional fellowship in Mohs sugery after their residencies. Good luck.

	The biggest advantage of Mohs is the ability to meticulously and carefully map and remove a skin cancer on a critical area with a high cure rate and avoiding taking too much tissue.&nbsp; The nose certainly falls into this category since this is an important cosmetic unit and avoiding anatomical distortion is very important since everyone looks at your nose.&nbsp; The type of tumor is also important since some are more aggressive and tumor clearance with microscopic mapping is ideal.&nbsp; A lot of information regarding the technique of Mohs Surgery is available from the American Academy of Dermatology, the American Society for Mohs Surgery.&nbsp; If a patient for health reasons is unable to have Mohs, radiation with an experienced radiation oncologist is always an option.

	Mohs surgery is the gold standard for treating certain skin cancers of the nose including the most common types: basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. &nbsp;It provides the highest cure rate with the least amount of tissue removed which results in the best possible cosmetic result. &nbsp;The Mohs surgeon is able to concisely remove small sections of skin to visualize under a microscope in order to map out the entire tumor so there is no guess work. &nbsp;The goal is to make sure all the skin cancer is removed but also to avoid removing any more tissue than is absolutely necessary in order to keep the defect size as small as possible.&nbsp;

	The high cure rate of Mohs can only be achieved by going to a qualified and trained Mohs surgeon. &nbsp;There are many doctors who advertise doing Mohs who have not gone thru the rigors of a formal fellowship program. &nbsp;The American College of Mohs Surgery (ACMS) is the only organization that requires its members to have successfully completed an extensive one- to two-year ACMS-approved fellowship training program after they have completed their years of residency training.&nbsp;

	You ask a very sophisticated question. There are many treatment options for basal cell cancer. Mohs surgery has the highest cure rate of any of the treatment methods but is only appropriate for certain types of Basal Cell Cancers, generally speaking, ones located on a critical area of the face, ones that are over a certain size on the body or ones that have been treated and have come back. The decision to undergo Mohs surgery is one most Mohs surgeons undertake after making sure the patient meets the appropriate criteria and that the patient understands all the other treatment options. Thus, you don't always have to undergo Mohs but you should discuss this with your dermatologist or Mohs surgeon because there may be certain criteria, even if your spot is very tiny, that might make it important to undergo Mohs surgery (ie aggressive histology).

	&nbsp;

	Regarding the closure, if you see an American College of Mohs Surgery member, they have extensive experience in facial reconstruction and most do more reconstructive facial surgery for skin cancers than any other specialist , so it might be something to consider. It is your decision though on who you want to close your hole following Mohs but in my practice, over 99.9% of the closures are done by me. The sheer volume and amount of skin cancer reconstruction is often the most important determinant. If you are seeing a plastic surgeon for the closure, but they spend time doing Breast implants or hand surgery, they might not be doing a whole lot of skin cancer reconstruction. Most importantly though is to make sure you feel comfortable with the person doing your closure.

	In terms of your restrictions, every surgeon is different, but in general you will need to avoid golfing for one to two weeks.

161029,question,,"Hi Marcia72Q,  Mohs surgery is a technique in which the dermatologist surgically removes the skin cancer and then reads the pathology. There is one fee which covers both components of this procedure. There will likely be the need for a surgical reconstruction or repair of the defect created from surgical removal of the tumor and that is typically not included in the fee for Mohs surgery. I would strongly recommend finding a fellowship trained Mohs surgeon to treat your BCC as mohs surgery affords the highest cure rate because it give the surgeon the greatest control of the tissue margin whilst sparing the greatest amount of healthy tissue.  This ensures for a lower recurrence rate and a frequently smaller scar than is afforded from other methods of treating non-melanoma skin cancer such as conventional excision.

	A well done Mohs surgery should have a higher cure rate (98%) than surgery done with frozen section (90%) AND should result in more tissue preservation. You can still use a plastic surgeon for reconstruction following the Mohs surgery if you wish. Dr. Kaufman explains the process very well.

	If the cancer is in an area with a lot of loose tissue (like the arm) excision with carefully examined margins can be fine as well. If the cancer is on the face or very large, go with Mohs. Good luck!

	Mohs surgery by definition and to be billed as such is required to have the removal and the pathology performed &nbsp;by one single and same surgeon. Anything else is not Mohs surgery. The billing is not separate for the pathology it is all bundled into the removal and examination under the microscope. You do not get a separate bill from a pathologist. My suggestion is that if you desire the advantages of Mohs surgery including a 99% cure rate then you seek out a fellowship-trained Mohs surgeon to perform your surgery. The entire procedure from start to finish inclduing removal, microscopic examination and reconstruction is perfomed by the same person. Frozen section is not the same as Mohs surgery in anyway shape or form except for the fact that the tissue is frozen immediately for examination.&nbsp; The processing of the tissue is completely different in almost all cases where Mohs examines 100% of the margins in a horizontal fashion while &quot;frozen section&quot; looks at less than 1% of the margins in a vertical breadloafing manner.&nbsp; That being said, whether you are paying out of your pocket or your insurance is paying for your care &nbsp;you need to be sure you are getting what you are paying for.

	Mohs surgery provides the highest cure rate for skin cancer. With cure rates approaching 99% for previously untreated basal cell carcinoma and 95% for basal cell carcinomas that have been treated before but recurred, Mohs surgery provides a higher cure rate than any other form of treatment including standard excision, curettage and electrodesiccation (scraping and burning), radiation or topical therapies. At the same time by starting with as small of a surgical margin as possible and then tracing out the roots of the skin cancer, Mohs surgery preserves the greatest amount of healthy tissue. For this reason Mohs is particularly useful in areas where tissue preservation is of paramount importance, such as the eyelids, nose, lips, ears, hands and genitalia.

However, there are many alternatives to treating skin cancers on the nose that should also be considered; those treatments range from traditional excision, to topical chemotherapy creams, radiation, scraping and burning, lasers, photodynamic therapy, and newer immunologic oral drugs.

	The eyelids are a very common location to develop skin cancer, and a common area to perform Mohs surgery. Because the Mohs technique removes skin cancer while sparing healthy tissue, the surgery is ideal for tumors that occur in cosmetic and functionally important areas such as the eyelid, ear, nose and lips. It is understandable to be nervous about a surgery in such a sensitive area. A number of techniques can be used to protect the eye when performing surgery in this location. Often, a temporary eye shield can be used to cover the eye, almost like a contact lens during the surgery. This helps prevent any damage to eye from the sharp instruments used during the surgery. The eye shields are typically opaque, so you can&#39;t see through them.

2953278,question,,"Mohs micrographic surgery is a tissues sparing technique of tumor excision where margins of the tumor are controlled microscopically at the time of excision to ensure full removal without taking any more tissue that is absolutely necessary  there are no margins of extra tissue taken to ensure that the tumor is gone, it is all confirmed visually with examination of 100% of the margins.An excision takes that extra insurance tissue around the tumor, and those margins are dependent on the type of tumor and its characteristics. These are then examined in a different fashion that looks at about 1% of the tissue margin to get an idea that it is clear, as opposed to the 100% that Mohs visualizes.When you add all of those up, Mohs gives you the highest cure rate of any modality, and it takes the least amount of tissue possible. That means you can be the most confident that your tumor is gone (above a 98% certainty for most tumors), while also knowing that the hole left behind is a small as it could possibly be.Mohs is traditionally reserved for areas where tissue sparing is key on the face, head, neck, hands, and genitals. It is also used when tumors have come back after excision, when tumors are particularly aggressive, or when tumors are particularly large. In those situations, Mohs is the most financially favorable way to take care of those tumors, even though it is more expensive than traditional excision, the outcomes are so much better that the cost ends up being lower in the long run. For all others, traditional excision is a more financially viable option. This is why your insurance made out improve a skin cancer on the arm, trunk, or leg unless it meets Mohs appropriate use criteria.To ensure you are receiving the highest level of care, seek out a modernly trained, new-school dermatologic surgeon, who is board certified and fellowship trained.Cameron Chesnut#realself500 Physician","Cameron Chesnut, MD, FAAD, FACMS, FASDS answers: What is the difference in Mohs surgery vs. excision surgeries?",/question/findlay-difference-moes-surgery-excision-surgeries

This cost INCLUDES taking the first skin specimen, the processing of slides, reading the slides and mapping of the tumor.  The only variable in this charge is whether it is taking place on the scalp, face, neck vs. the arms, trunk and lower extremities.  Generally, most doctors accept insurance for Mohs. I cannot comment on the price for those who do not but this is a reasonable question to ask any Mohs surgeon in consultation.  By definition, a Mohs surgeon is both the surgeon and the pathologist.  There is NO separate charge for pathology.  If there is, you are not going to an approved Mohs surgeon.2. Second layer. Again, the cost includes all of the components of the first layer. This layer is typically less expensive because it does not require the same tray set-up etc. from scratch.3. Repair. Completely depends on the type of repair you are having.

	Mohs micrographic surgery is the treatment of choice for recurrent basal cell carcinoma. According to prior data in the scientific literature, the cure rate for Mohs surgery for a recurrent basal cell carcinoma is approximately 95%, which is much higher than the cure rates with surgical excision, curettage and electrodesiccation, and radiation therapy.

	Levulan and blue light would not be a good option for treatment of a recurrent basal cell carcinoma. While this procedure might be a good alternative for selected cases of actinic keratoses, I would recommend Mohs for recurrent basal cell carcinomas as well as basal cell carcinomas on the nose/eyelids/lips/ears and poorly defined basal cell carcinomas and agressive types of basal cell carcinoma (e.g. perineural, infiltrative, sclerosing, metatypical).

	Best plan is to meet with your doctor; discuss your options and choose an appropriate treatment. Good luck.

	Yes, Mohs Surgery offers the highest cure rate for non-melanoma skin cancer, such as squamous cell. &nbsp;Because squamous cell cancer can metastasize (i.e. spread to distant body sites) and result in death and inadvertent incomplete removal by less accurate methods increases this risk, the most successful treatment method, Mohs Surgery is often the best option, especially when treating an aggressive and/or large skin cancer. &nbsp;

Typically the hair will be lost in the tumor involved area but with suturing normal skin together, only the suture line should have loss of hair since the surgeon will be pulling together normal unaffected skin.

	Prior to performing surgery for a skin cancer using Mohs micrographic surgery, the diagnosis should be confirmed with a biopsy, otherwise, you might undergo unnecessary surgery, with risks that are not warranted. The biopsy could be a frozen biopsy and if the results prove there to be a skin cancer, then the Mohs surgery could be done. Usually, a biopsy is done in a standard fashion and sent to a laboratory for permanent section analysis (not frozen). Then when the result returns days later, the surgery is scheduled if needed.

	The issue of how long to wait for treatment of a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is not perfectly understood and in Canada it is influenced by availability of Mohs surgery.

	For a spot with minimal symptoms that is not growing noticeably, waiting a few months is not likely to change things much.&nbsp; In the US, with the ready availability of Mohs surgery, most patients in your situation would be treated within a month - this may reflect more the availability rather than the need.&nbsp; In British Columbia, there are currently only two Mohs surgeons in full time practice (in Vancouver); hence the long wait.

	Basal cell carcinoma grows slowly over years often and it is not uncommon to see patients with lesions untreated for 2-3 years that they ignored.&nbsp; They only very rarely spread from the skin so their risk to your general health is low.&nbsp; They can grow deeply (eventually into bone), so they are typically removed like any other cancer.

	In conclusion, there is no right answer especially in a system with limited availability, though most would say 8 months is long.&nbsp; If you are concerned, you can try and be seen sooner in Alberta or Washington State, or alternatively you can get the opinion from the dermatologist who did the biopsy.

1568444,question,,"Recovery after your Mohs procedure depends on the location of your cancer, the extent of the cancer, the size of the surgical defect, and the type of reconstruction that was performed to repair your surgical defect. For example, a 1 cm defect on your cheek in front of your ear that was repaired with a linear closure may feel sore or throb the night after surgery but should feel fine the day afterwards. A big cancer on your forehead that needed a large flap will likely cause bruising and swelling around your eyes that may last a week and give you a major headache that night. You may need pain medication in that case. The actual Mohs procedure uses precise microscopic margin control to remove your cancer with the best cure rate and the most narrow margins. Once the cancer is out, your Mohs surgeon will discuss the best repair option for you...this should give you the best cosmetic result and take into account your lifestyle and ability to care for your wound. You should leave with specific directions about how to care for your wound, what you will need, and emergency contact information for the physician. Most facial repairs will throb a bit the night after surgery and leave some swelling and/or bruising around the incision site. Any repair above the eyebrows will likely give you a black eye or two. Sutures are typically removed in 7 days and the scar will settle and mature and fade over the next 3-12 months. Repairs on the trunk and extremities may feel tighter, can also cause bruising and swelling and may require you to remain inactive while sutures are in place, about 2 weeks. Repairs on the leg are more likely to open up and become infected without the proper wound care and can take the longest to heal. I like to see all my surgical patients 3 months post to make sure we are both happy with the outcome of the repair and see if any tweaks need to be done. I expect that at 3 months, most scars will have flattened out and be a little pink. That discoloration typically fades over the next few months and the scar should just blend and not be noticeable.

	Mohs surgery refers to the technique by which a skin cancer is surgically removed, typically by a dermatologist with expertise and training in this technique. The wounds created by removing the cancer can range from very small, shallow wounds that can heal with a bandaid to large complex wounds requiring significant surgery to reconstruct. Each case therefore will have different recovery times but in general, wounds requiring sutures will typically need bandages for several days to a week. In the first day or two larger more noticeable bandages are used to apply pressure to minimize bleeding. Afterwards, less obvious dressings can be applied with each surgeon having their preferred wound care techniques. In the absence of complications, makeup can be used for the stitch lines several days after the surgery to help camouflage (more relevant for women) but there are also flesh colored paper tapes that are quite helpful at camouflage. The amount of swelling around the surgery site and its duration will vary depending on size, location of the wound and the type of reconstruction chosen. Your Mohs surgeon can answer this more specifically based on your tumor and the expected extent of the surgery.

	The cause of the bump could be a thickened scar, a cyst, a reaction to suture material and even recurrence of the skin cancer. Because of this last possibility, I would recommend that you see someone to evaluate the possibility of skin cancer recurrence. This is most easily done with a small incisional biopsy. Most skin cancers occur in the first two years after surgery, and while Mohs surgery does provide the highest cure rate for skin cancer, nothing is 100% perfect. So I would recommend seeing a doctor, preferably a fellowship-trained Mohs surgeon (i.e. member of the American College of Mohs Surgery), and confirm what is causing that lump. Once recurrence of the skin cancer is excluded the problem should be able to be improved. By the way if the lump is a recurrence, Mohs surgery is still going to give the highest cure rate for a recurrent tumor.

How many layers will it take to clear the tumor?The Mohs procedure is billed according to the number of layers, or how many times the tissue has to be cut out and processed to achieve clear margins.  Your Mohs surgeon will try to balance clearing the tumor in as few layers as possible while also trying to spare as much healthy tissue as possible.

6046114,question,,"While a BB-sized BCC of the scalp could be very small, it could represent the tip of the iceberg. In general, the best person to answer your questions is the Mohs surgeon performing the procedure. All I can do is tell you what I do. Hair does need to be shaved from the operative site as it can make its way into the field. I usually start by shaving about 1 cm around the visible tumor. I then begin by treating the site with electro-dessication and curettage(burning and scraping). Most BCC's are soft and mushy and scrape out fairly easily, normal skin is a lot firmer and resists being scraped out. This then gives me a good idea of how deep and wide the defect will be. It also reduces the number of stages of Mohs surgery necessary to clear the tumor.( I must tell you that many Mohs surgeons do NOT do this and for various reasons. Since payment for Mohs is, in general, by number of stages, reducing the number of stages reduces reimbursement). Mohs surgery can then be performed. Once tumor has been totally removed, you will be left with a defect, let's say the size of a quarter as an example. I will show this to my patient and go over options, let heal or repair. I go over these in detail explaining what needs to be done and what to expect as a result. Let's say that I explain that the quarter sized defect can be simplyremoved by excising the wound in fusiform fashion(banana or football shaped) and then sewn closed. The resulting closure wound will then be between 3 to 4 times as long as the width of a quarter and, because the tension of scalp skin is usually significantly high, the scar would be subject to stretch-back(widening somewhat to get back closer to the size of the original fusiform excision). Not pretty. Other repairs can be performed such as local flaps(grafts are NOT appropriate in your situation). However, there is no guarantee that the flap will take, and you may be left with a T or Z shaped or curvy scar, and with hair going in different directions from normal. Not attractive for short hair. The other option is to let this heal by itself, called second intention healing. With proper wound care it would take the wound 3 to 4 weeks to totally heal and it would most likely heal flat and would contract to about 1/3rd the size of the original quarter, smaller than even a dime. This could then receive hair grafts, if necessary, or excised in fusiform fashion for a smaller scar than if it was done right after the surgery. While this option takes additional time for healing, it almost certainly will give the best possible cosmetic result. However, this is not a popular option for most Mohs surgeons, who generally will not even mention it to their patients because, as one Mohs surgeon told me, you don't get paid to let it heal. By now you should be well-informed and should know what questions to ask your Mohs surgeon before having the procedure.

53429,question,,"Mohs is a technique for removal of skin cancers by a specially trained group of dermatologists (often called Mohs specialists or Mohs surgeons). The principle advantage of the Mohs technique is that the same physician that removes the skin cancer also subsequently examines the removed skin cancer and surrounding margin of normal skin under a microscope to make sure that the skin cancer has been completely removed. The patient is kept in the Mohs specialists' office and the wound is not repaired until the skin cancer has been completely removed. The Mohs specialist therefore acts as both the dermatologist and the pathologist. After successful removal of the skin cancer reconstructive surgery is performed to repair the hole (defect). Depending on a number factors such as patient preference, size and location of the defect, complexity of the defect, aesthetic expectations of the patient, and need for sedation, the resulting defect may be either repaired by a plastic surgeon or by the Mohs specialist.The Mohs technique allows for mapping of the removed tumor so that when a portion of the tumor is left behind, it can be seen under the microscope and it can be determined roughly where in the wound it is located. If the tumor was not completely removed the first time, more tissue is removed (this is called the second stage) and again subsequently examined until the skin cancer has been completely removed.This process can take several stages and many hours to complete but offers the patient a very high (close to 97%) success rate in removal of the skin cancer as measured by lack of recurrence (meaning the skin cancer coming back in the same spot in a few years).The dermatologist performing the Mohs procedure may also perform the reconstruction (plastic surgery repair) of the defect left after removal of the cancer. The decision of whether the Mohs specialist or a plastic surgeon performs the reconstruction depends on a number of factors:Patient preferenceSize of defectComplexity of defectLocation of defectAesthetic expectationsNeed for sedationRecovery (measured in terms of time off from work or social activities) can take between several days to several weeks based on the size, complexity, and location of the defect.For more information visit","Sam Naficy, MD answers: What can I expect during Mohs Surgery recovery?",/question/what-aftercare-mohs-surgery

	In my opinion your best chance of removing this cancer, getting the highest cure rate and preserving the greatest amount of healthy tissue is to have the skin cancer treated by Mohs surgery. You already had it excised once, and the surgical margins are positive. You might have the same result if the cancer is re-excised without the Mohs surgery. This technique (Mohs surgery) traces out the roots of the cancer so there is no chance that the surgical margins will be involved when the wound is repaired. I'm not sure why the Mohs surgery would be performed in the hospital. Generally, Mohs surgery is done in the doctor's office. In Mohs surgery one person acts as both surgeon and pathologist. If either of those duties is delegated to another doctor, it is not Mohs surgery. My recommendation for Mohs surgery is that you have a Fellow of American College of Mohs Surgery perform your procedure. Fellows of this College have completed an additional 1-2 year fellowship in Mohs surgery and therefore are well trained and experienced in the procedure. The repair can be performed by whomever you wish. You could have the Mohs surgeon perform the repair, or if you prefer, you could have a plastic surgeon do the repair. Good luck.

It is impossible to tell how deep and how wide this tumor has spread just by looking at the surface tumor. The greater the spread, the greater the damage to affected structures. Since removal of the tumor is essential because, left untreated, a tumor like this could eventually involve your entire nose, any difficulty you have after removal is a result of destruction by the tumor, not by the procedure removing it. Looking at it in this way puts the blame into its proper perspective. Mohs surgery is designed to remove all the tumor while sparing the greatest amount of normal tissue, and doing so up to 99% of the time. No other treatment modality even comes remotely close. While you have other treatment options, why would you settle for something with a much lower cure rate? Additionally, some treatments, like radiation therapy, not only can lead to some of the same problems as surgery once treatment is completed, but can also lead to skin cancer in the radiation treated area. I will say this, nasal tip tumors, in my experience of 38 years, rarely lead to breathing difficulties.

39747,question,,"Although large skin cancers can be seen with the naked eye, it takes a microscope to visualize cancer at the cellular level. The only way to prevent recurrence of localized skin cancer is to remove each and every cell; otherwise any remaining skin cancer cells can reproduce and cause a regrowth of the cancer.Mohs surgery is a specialized method to remove skin cancer. It is named in honor of Frederick Mohs, the physician who developed the technique.   Mohs surgery differs from other methods of treating skin cancer by the use of detailed mapping techniques and onsite microscopic examination of the surgically removed skin. Mohs skin cancer surgery allows for the tissue to be examined during the operation through a microscope to ensure that all of the cancer cells have been removed adequately, and that removal of healthy, cancer-free tissue is minimized. Using the Mohs microscopic surgery technique there is a 95% cure rate.Mohs skin cancer surgery is then followed by careful reconstructive surgery to repair the defect (hole) and to yield an aesthetically pleasing result.Your recovery from MOHS surgery will depend on the extent and depth of the area that was removed and the method in which is was &quot;closed&quot;.   Larger areas may require that your surgeon create flaps of skin that are rotated or otherwise moved around to reposition or redrape the skin in order to close the area of the defect (the hole).  In other instances, a graft of skin may need to be taken from another area of your body and sutured into place in order to cover the area. Sometimes the surgeon will create a &quot;purse-string&quot; to cinch the hole closed.Your surgeon may cover the area with a bandage, a patch, a pressure dressing, or other type of dressing to prevent shearing forces, bleeding, fluid collection, or dirt in the wound.  Sometimes, the area is only closed with a few stitches and recovery is no more complicated that applying antibiotic ointment, keeping the wound clean and dry, and avoiding sun.Regardless of the extent of the surgery, you should not smoke or use nicotine which decreases oxygen supply to the wound and will impair healing.  Depending on the area, stitches usually come out in 5-7 days on the face or eyelids, or 7-14 days on the torso or extremities.For the long term, you should remember to apply broad coverage sunblock everyday (even if it's cloudy) and avoid sun exposure during peak hours (10am-2pm) to stave off more sun damage which could lead to future skin cancer.","Jonathan Hoenig, M.D. answers: What can I expect during Mohs Surgery recovery?",/question/what-aftercare-mohs-surgery

	Most importantly it depends on the type of skin cancer being treated. Basal cell carcinomas tend to be slow growing. Waiting one month or two would be acceptable and would likely not change the size of the resultant defect significantly or the chance to cure the cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma or some other type of malignancy should likely be treated more quickly as these may grow quicker or some have a chance to metastasize. Delay of surgery for those types of cancer should not be considered. Best option is to discuss the situation with the Mohs surgeon, preferably a member of the American College of Mohs Surgery (ACMS).

	Most importantly, you need to realize that this is your health and your safety. I&#39;ve had patients delay a Mohs surgery (for a BCC) for about 6 months. In that timeframe, I know one particular site grew and developed and so the surgery was more in-depth and the repair was much, much larger. You need to consult the physician who informed you about the needed Mohs and let him/her know what you have coming up. Depending on the size of the current site and the type of cancer, you may be fine to wait, or you should consider getting it done asap and letting it heal before your big events. Talk to your doctor!

	There are many good indications for Mohs surgery including recurrent skin cancers, locations on areas important for tissue preservation and at higher risk of recurrence (e.g. nose, eyelids, ears, lips), aggressive types of skin cancer (e.g. morpheaform, infiltrative basal cell carcinoma), large size, poorly defined margins, immunosuppressed patients.

	Best option is to discuss with your dermatologist what is the best option for you and for your skin cancer and why. Mohs provides the highest cure rate and preserves the greatest amount of healthy tissue, but there may be other options that would be better given other factors.

	Mohs surgery is usually reserved for areas where we try to preserve as much skin as possible. Typically on areas like the trunk, arms, legs, you can take a wider excision because it&#39;s easier to close and there is more skin to give. On areas like the face, hands, genitals, ears, etc. we need to make the smallest excisions possible and preserve as much skin as possible, so we only excise small areas level by level, widening and deepening only in needed areas, as are read during slides prepped during the Mohs procedure.

	With all of that being said, if you have had this SCC removed more than once, or if it is extremely large, then a Mohs procedure might be necessary. For specifics on why your physician is recommending this, you need to ask him/her why the procedure is needed.

	The procedure might cost you between $1000-$2000, depending on the number of slides made, the number of levels done during the procedure, and the type of closure done.

	Typically eyelid defects created following Mohs cancer surgery are closed immediately or the next day. &nbsp;Very small defect can be allowed to heal on their own. &nbsp;However, when the defect involves the eyelid margin, or the tear sac area, or larger portions of the eyelid, the Mohs surgeon will generally arrange for the closure (reconstruction) to be performed by an oculoplastic surgeon. &nbsp;It is ideal if you can meet the oculoplastic surgeon before hand and know what the plan will be. &nbsp;If you open your mouth and ask for this, it is more likely that you will get this type of reconstruction. &nbsp;Sometimes the Mohs surgeon feels a lesion near the eyelid can be handled just by the Mohs surgeon and that is fine. &nbsp;However, sometimes the lesion proves to larger than anticipated and this can lead to the 6 PM urgent oculoplastic consultation. &nbsp;Regarding patching, small defects can be closed without patching the eye. &nbsp;When the defect involves the eyelid margin and you need to be reconstructed either later that same day or the next day, yes it is common to patch the eye. &nbsp;Because of the large variation in what may be needed, it is impossible to predict what you will need. &nbsp;If you are nervous about how the reconstruction will be handled, insist on meeting the oculoplastic surgeon ahead of the Mohs cancer surgery.

	In my opinion the most appropriate treatment for a basal cell carcinoma on the hairline that has been cut out and still has positive margins is Mohs surgery. Mohs surgery is best performed by a dermatologist who has completed a Mohs and reconstructive surgery fellowship and is a member of the American College of Mohs surgery. With Mohs surgery, the pathology is done live so there is an immediate answer and skin cancer can be removed without removing too much normal skin. Plastic surgeons do not have the formal training in reading slides to perform Mohs surgery, so while they are experts at many different things, Mohs surgery is not one of them.

	First off, I am sure you have an overwhelming amount of stress around this surgery. I would take a deep breathe and relax. I am not sure of the details of this surgery but it sounds like this area was allowed to heal by second intention (on its own) following surgery. This is sometimes used instead of stitching, especially in an area like the scalp where there is not a lot of slack skin to pull together. When a wound heals this way, it takes a long time, around 2 months like the other two Mohs and Reconstructive surgeons said. The way you are describing it, makes it sound like it is healing normally but I would agree with the other two surgeons and recommend you contact the Mohs surgeon to see if he/she can take a look at the area. The wound care that you are doing is a good regimen and one does not need to use an antibiotic unless there is an infection. Although it is scary, often times it is ok to wash the area with soap and water, which is what I recommend to my patients. Check with you Mohs surgeon again to see what their preference is.

	Mohs surgery is considered the gold standard for treating skin cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma, because it provides the highest cure rates, lowest recurrence, spares healthy tissue, and minimizes scarring. This is why Mohs is often recommended when skin cancers develop on the face. Having said that, a minimal scar is still a scar, and it is not the only way to treat these cancers. Blue light ALA photodynamic therapy has been used to treat basal cell carcinoma. In general, the best results were obtained when it was used to treat small and superficial tumors. One study showed that Blue light treatment of basal cell carcinoma failed in 25% of cases. This is compared to Mohs which has a less than 1% recurrence rate. In my own practice, I use Blue Light to treat precancerous lesions and Mohs to treat skin cancers on the nose and other sensitive areas. If you have already had 4 skin cancers, you might still benefit from Blue Light for its preventative benefits. I recommend speaking to your dermatologist about these different options.

8627154,question,,"When a sutured wound opens up, it's called a dehiscence. You have 2 reasonable choices. One is to return to your Mohs surgeon. The second is to take care of the wound yourself. In order to get this to heal properly, you need to do the following. Clean the wound thoroughly with sterile normal saline until you get down to normal appearing pinktissue. If it starts bleeding, that's not necessarily a bad thing, because bleeding will foster the growth of granulation tissue which is rich in blood vessels and is capable of filling the wound all the way to the surface. Apply Vaseline to the wound and cover the wound with a non-stick bandaid.Clean the wound dailywith the saline and Q-tips and do not leave behind any yellowish material. Re-cover the wound as before. When the granulation tissue gets to just below the skin surface, confine your wound care to gentle dabbing of the wound with a gauze pad moistened with the saline and re-cover the wound. This will allow new skin to cover the wound from the outside edges to the central part of the wound and contract the wound at the same time. This should be completed very quickly and the wound will be pink but smaller and level with the rest of the skin in that area. At that point it's OK to keep the wound uncovered.This process will leave you with a normal appearing area once the pinkness fades away. This is called second intention healing and more often then not will result in the area appearing pretty much normal. Most doctors doing Mohs surgery have no training or experience with this.

	Mohs is a very specialized surgery that is required for specific types and locations of BCCs. It is not required for all BCCs. Some can be removed with a currette, or other excision, or Efudex, and sometimes you do need Mohs. It depends on what the biospy shows - the location, depth, and width of the BCC. What we think of as a very tiny BCC may have roots under the skin; this is when Mohs is used. Efudex is effective only for very superficial BCCs. It cannot penetrate deep enough into the skin to get to the roots of specific types of BCCs. One additional thing - Efudex is great, but also takes weeks of use and can really freak people out as the skin becomes red, gooey, and rather icky for many people. A lot of women, especially, just won't do it. Which then, the BCC isn't treated effectively and keeps on growing! You certainly won't be on the golf course quicker by choosing Efudex, and depending on your biospy, it may not even get to the depths of your BCC. If you have questions about which procedure is being recommended and why - always ask your doctor!

	As a general rule, if a wound is not completely healed, keeping it covered with an antibiotic or bland ointment (e.g. Vaseline, Aquaphor, Polysporin) is a good idea. The wound produces various factors in the fluid of the wound that stimulate wound healing. Allowing the wound to dry out or &quot;scab up&quot; removes these factors and the wound heals more slowly and with greater difficulty. As a general rule, I have patients keep the wound moist with an antibiotic salve and cover it with a non-stick bandage (e.g. Telfa) to keep the antibiotic salve intact and protect the wound from sun exposure. As the oculoplastic surgeon was responsible for reconstructing your wound following Mohs surgery, I would follow up with that doctor. If you need a second opinion, you can talk to the Mohs surgeon or contact another oculoplastic or plastic surgeon. Good luck.

	In my opinion Mohs micrographic surgery provides the best option for skin cancers on the nose when you&#39;re considering surgery. Mohs surgery starts with the smallest surgical margin around the skin cancer and traces out the roots of the skin cancer. Generally for a skin cancer on the nose the Mohs surgeon would start with a 1-2 mm margin around the skin cancer. For routine surgical excision without Mohs the surgical margin should be 3-4 mm. By examining a higher percentage of the actual surgical margins the Mohs surgeon can trace out the skin cancer. The result is the highest cure rate (approx. 98.5-99% for previoulsy untreated skin cancers per the scientific literature) and preservation of the highest amount of normal healthy skin. By creating the smallest defect and preserving healthy tissue, the reconstruction should be the simplest possible, but the key thing is to make sure that the person performing the Mohs surgery is well-trained and experienced in Mohs surgery and nasal reconstruction. Fellows of the American College of Mohs Surgery require additional training in Mohs, reconstruction and interpretation of pathology slides. Of course, there are many other options available including topical chemotherapy, curettage and electrodesiccation, surgery without Mohs, radiation therapy. Best to talk to your dermatologist about all of these options and then talk to the surgeon about their training and experience.&nbsp;Good luck.

The main advantage to allowing it to heal in some on its own first are that it will likely necessitate a small flap/graft.  Secondly, there are many times in which the cosmetic result from allowing a wound to heal in by itself completely can be superior to that achieved from a flap/graft (ie. this is often seen on the nose, depending on how deep the wound is). The down side is that there are times in which the cosmetic result is not as acceptable because the scar appears as a faint white patch that can be less appealing than a series of lines that can be strategically placed to mininize their appearance. Another main disadvantage is that it often takes a long time for the wound to heal in by itself, even partially and will likely require a larger bandage for a longer period of time.Depending on the size of the wound, your Mohs surgeon may want you to be on antibiotics during a portion of the healing process. It is important to take your lifestyle needs into account (can you accept a larger bandage for a longer period of time, decreased physical activity for a longer period of time) when making this decision.

160731,question,,"Mike,As your doctor likely discussed with you following surgery during the discussion about the treatment options available for the wound, many wounds will heal if left alone.  Most wounds left to heal on their own heal will do so with worse scarring than if they are surgically closed immediately - however the forehead is one of the few areas that does tend to do ok and in some cases does brilliantly.  The longer a wound remains open, typically, the worse the scarring.  We know that wounds that have not healed by 21 days tend on average to heal with thicker scarring than those that heal before that (we know this from the burn literature).  Smoking, nutrition and general health all affect wound healing.In addition to an unpredictable cosmetic outcome, secondary intent healing is limited by inconvenience to the patient (long time to heal); infection is very, very rare in such wounds on the face.Most of the doctors who perform the Mohs procedure are dermatologists and many do great work.  There are seven of us worldwide (myself included) who are formally trained in Mohs surgery and are also board certified plastic surgeons; the advantage is the highest cure rate from Mohs, followed by immediate cosmetic reconstruction. I prefer to close wounds since I feel the result is predictably better when I surgically limit the number of factors/hurdles I am asking the wound to overcome.That being said, I wasn't there for  your cancer removal so I can't comment on the depth or what your doctor had in mind.  I would trust your doctor (you chose to go to them in the first place) and know they have a plan in mind to ensure the wound heals in an optimal cosmetic fashion; I would certainly encourage you to contact them with any apprehension or concerns that you have; I would give them the benefit of a doubt that they would want to know of your thoughts and concerns and it would likely help you both to discuss it.   An unsightly scar after secondary intent can typically be addressed down the road to make it look better as well and a suboptimal result doesn't mean anything was done wrong - sometimes it takes a few steps to get to the final result.  The wound healing cascade takes 9-12 months during which scars tend to soften, lighten and become flatter and more supple so patience is also a virtue.","Justin Piasecki, MD answers: How to repair Mohs surgery wound?",/question/repair-mohs-surgery-wound

	Squamous cell carcinoma is a cancer of the skin. If left untreated these lesions can grow deeper and larger and it is possible for squamous cell carcinoma to metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body and cause death. Early detection and treatment by a dermatologist is key. If the squamous cell carcinoma is located on the face, scalp, neck, ears, hands, feet or are larger than a certain size they are best treated by Mohs surgery which has the highest cure rate and is the most tissue sparing procedure. Mohs surgery is best done by a dermatologist who has done fellowship training in Mohs surgery and is a member of the American College of Mohs Surgery.&nbsp;

	I am often asked, &quot;What can I expect after Mohs&#39;?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple answer is that everyone will get a scar as any&nbsp;time that the skin is cut, a scar will result. Sometimes it heals so well the scar is barely noticeable, while&nbsp;at other times it is very obvious.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohs&#39; surgery is a method of tumor removal only. In some cases, the wound may be left to heal without any stitches, which takes anywhere from several weeks (for small thin lesions on the face) to three or more months (for larger wounds on the legs). Most patients choose to have the wound closed using Plastic Surgery. The final result is very dependent upon the surgeon, as well as many other factors. Choosing&nbsp;a reconstructive surgeon is an extremely important variable&nbsp;in determining one&#39;s&nbsp;cosmetic outcome.

	For any closure one can expect&nbsp;some, all, or none&nbsp;the following:

	
		mild discomfort
	
		mild bruising
	
		mild spotting of blood on the bandage


	For wounds left to heal without stitches, one can expect the following:

	
		mild to moderate discomfort
	
		healing that may take 3 weeks to over&nbsp;3 months requiring daily wound&nbsp;care
	
		the wound will usually fill in from the bottom and close in from the sides
	
		a scar that usually will become white with time
	
		mild to moderate swelling (especially with leg wounds)


	For skin grafts, one can expect the following:

	
		the graft is usually bandaged in a way that it must remain dry for one week
	
		the graft will&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;look like a patch on a tire, although often the results can be very acceptable depending upon many factors which are too numerous to discuss here, but should be discussed with your surgeon.
	
		Less pain compared to second intention, if the donor site (where the graft is taken from) is closed using stitches.
	
		mild to moderate&nbsp;discomfort at the donor site if stitches are not used
	
		There is always a risk that the graft will not survive, which may result in more scar.

171510,question,,"Repair after Mohs surgery can happen in a variety of ways and for a variety of reasons:1. Sometimes no repair is necessary -- the wound will heal on its own without stitches.2. Often sutures are placed immediately after the tumor is cleared, with a linear repair, flap, or graft performed the same day.3. The linear repair, flap, or graft can be delayed by several days or weeks to enhance its survival or appearance.  Sometimes this is done to improve outcome, sometimes it is due to patient (or surgeon) fatigue and the need to continue on another day.And then there is this reason:  Due to the &quot;multiple surgery reduction rule&quot;, the repair done on the same day as another surgery (excision or Mohs) is often only paid by the insurance company at a fraction of the true fee.  This varies by company. Sometimes the amount paid is enough to cover the cost of supplies, time, etc... and sometimes it is not... so the doctor actually loses money for treating you.Some offices require patients to return on a different day for repair after Mohs in order to collect the entire amount owed (and cover all costs of performing surgery), but it is a minority of practices that do this.  Most perform what the patients need at the right time, usually the same day, regardless of the cost and the lack of reimbursement.

	Best option is to communicate your concerns to your doctor. Tell him what your fears are, and perhaps he can explain so that the procedure is less frightening. I would not recommend an anxiolytic, such as valium, unless absolutely necessary and only with the consent of your surgeon and most imprortantly after you have given informed consent to the procedure.

	Most patient are frightened by a surgical procedure, especially if they have not undergone a similar procedure before. Speaking for our patients, most of them are much more comfortable and less fearful after we explain what we&#39;re going to do (usually at the office visit). It is the &quot;unknown&quot; portion that I think is most frightening.

	As a general rule, Mohs surgery starts with the smallest surgical margin possible and then the roots are traced out. As a result, you get the highest cure rate (i.e. best chance that it won&#39;t come back) and you preserve the greatest amount of healthy tissue (i.e. only cancerous tissue is removed).

	Best option is for you to discuss your concerns with your doctor, whether this is regarding the Mohs surgery or the reconstruction. Ask what your options are, what are the risks, what are the complications? Hopefully, your doctor can relieve your concerns. Best of luck.

This is because the nearby hairs were put into a sleep phase and shed after the procedure. In that case the hairs start to return 3-6 months later.

	Mohs surgery is going to give you the highest cure rate for a basal cell carcinoma. According to the scientific literature, the cure rate for Mohs surgery is 98.5-99%&nbsp;for&nbsp;a basal cell carcinoma not previously treated. If the skin cancer has been previously treated, the cure rate for Mohs surgery is 95%... both of these&nbsp; scenarios is much better than other forms of treatment. In addition, Mohs surgery preserves the greatest amount of healthy tissue because the surgical margins start out smaller than conventional surgery and the roots of the skin cancer are subsequently traced out. In my opinion it is best to pick a member or fellow of the American College of Mohs Surgery. (As point of full disclosure, I am a member of the American College of Mohs&nbsp;Surgery). &nbsp;These individuals have completed a 1-2 year fellowship in Mohs surgery after their residency. This additional training and experience is frequently helpful when dealing with difficult skin cancers on the nose, eyelids, ears, etc. Regarding the repair... I would not predict how to repair the defect until I know what size, shape and depth the defect is, and we won&#39;t know that until after the Mohs surgery. Best option is to have a doctor who performs a lot of nasal reconstruction perform yours. Many fellowship-trained Mohs surgeons have extensive experience in nasal reconstruction; another option is a plastic surgeon again so long as they have a great deal of nasal reconstruction experience.

	The wound (defect) created after Mohs surgery will need some sort of approach to yield the best result. This can involve primary stitching or more involved movement of neighboring skin (flap) or skin from another site (graft). In some cases the final result from allowing a wound to heal on its own is comparable (or even better) than a surgical reconstruction. This is primarily dependent on the size of the wound and the location on the face. An experienced Mohs surgeon or plastic surgeon can give you the best advice on the likely and possible outcomes if you were allow the wound to simply heal on its own. In my practice, second intention healing is a perfectly good choice in some patients. In many cases, as well, the wound will shrink as it heals yielding a smaller scar. If the final scar is bothersome, in many cases, it can be revised in a subsequent procedure (laser, surgical or other).

Dissolving sutures - Sutures that have not completely dissolved can often be felt below the surface. &nbsp;Sometimes they will try to work their way to the surface before they dissolve completely, spitting. &nbsp; Sometimes they can also fester a little, causing a small pimple, sometimes even draining a little pus. &nbsp;Sometimes your doctor may recommend making a tiny knick or incision overtop to express and remove the remaining stitch material.2. Scar - Sometimes nodules of scar tissue can develop. &nbsp;Sometimes this occurs around the deep stitches. &nbsp;These often soften overtime as the scar matures. &nbsp;Occasionally people&nbsp;develop abnormally thick scars called hypertrophic scars (HTS) or keloid scars. &nbsp;These thicker scars tend to occur more often in&nbsp;people with darker skin types. &nbsp;Sometimes these thicker scars benefits from early intervention with treatments like steroid injections into the scar or application of a silicone dressing.3.

	Your best option is to discuss the situation with the doctor who will be performing Mohs surgery. It depends on whether the wound is closed or whether it is allowed to heal in by itself (secondary intention healing). Wounds on the legs tend to heal more slowly. (Blood flows downhill well, but getting uphill back to the heart is more difficult.) If allowed to heal by secondary intention, the wound will likely take 4 or more weeks to heal. If sutured, the sutures are usually taken out within two weeks. Talk to your doctor to make sure that you don't have any problems on your trip. Good luck.

	With the Mohs Surgery, your surgeon provides the most precise method for removal of the cancerous tissue, while sparing the greatest amount of healthy tissue. For this reason, the Mohs surgery may result in a significantly smaller surgical defect and less noticeable scarring, as compared to other methods of skin cancer treatment. I recommend the Mohs Surgery for the removal of skin cancer in areas where maximum preservation of healthy tissue is desirable for cosmetic and functional purposes, such as the face.I&nbsp;may also recommend the Mohs Surgery for lesions that have recurred following prior treatment, or for lesions which have the greatest likelihood of recurrence.

	
		Mohs micrographic surgery is the most effective and state-of-the-art procedure for skin cancer today, which offers the highest potential for recovery - even if the skin cancer has been previously treated by another method and recurred. Select from the following pages to learn more.


	&nbsp;

	
		Mohs surgery has the highest success rate of all treatments for skin cancer - up to 99 percent. The Mohs technique is also the treatment of choice for cancers of the face and other sensitive areas as it relies on the accuracy of a microscopic surgical procedure to trace the edges of the cancer and ensure complete removal of all tumors down to the roots during the initial surgery.

	Mohs surgery is an excellent choice for treatment of a melanoma near the eyelid. These types of melanomas in situ (frequently called lentigo malignas) have poorly defined margins and are located in areas where preservation of healthy tissue is very important and where other types of surgery have a higher risk of recurrence.

	The key is to see a Mohs surgeon with extensive experience with this type of malignancy and treatment with Mohs. These types of tumors require that the tissue be cut properly and not overfrozen, and interpretation of melanoma frozend-section slides requires that the surgeon have a great deal of experience (in other words, it is not as straight forward as some basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas). A number of Mohs surgeons use immunostains to highlight the melanoma cells more clearly. In my opinion your best option is to see a Mohs surgeon who has completed a fellowship (after residency) in Mohs surgery and is a fellow of the American College of Mohs Surgery. Talk to your potential surgeon about how they would perform Mohs surgery for melanoma and what their experience is.

	Regarding cure rates, the recurrence rate for lentigo maligna (melanoma in situ on chronically sun damaged skin) through standard surgical excision (i.e. not Mohs) is historically 6-20%. That is because a standard 5 mm margin is inadequate to clear the tumor 50% of the time. The recurrence rates for this type of tumor with Mohs surgery (and the author from that particular study) is 0.3% (Greg Bricca MD, Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, 2005) and 0% (CL Temple MD and JP Arlette MD, Journal of Surgical Oncology, 2006). There are other articles as well that look at recurrence rates for Mohs and melanoma. If you're interested and have access to the scientific literature, you could also look up articles by John A Zitelli MD on other articles regarding Mohs surgery and melanoma.

	Good luck

	Most repairs are performed on the day of the Mohs surgery. I tend to perform all necessary repairs on the ssame day. Some doctors like to allow the wound to heal for a period of time before applying a skin graft. This allows the base of the wound to fill in somewhat so there is less of a depression on the grafted skin. In my mind there isn&#39;t really any benefit to allowing a wound to heal before performing a flap repair. By the way many areas will heal well if allowed to heal by themselves. This is called secondary intention healing and is most useful on the concave areas of the temples, ears, eyes, and nose.

	As with any cancer, prompt and early treatment often yields the best results. The Mohs surgery technique is used to treat a number of different types of skin cancer, each with their own characteristics. Basal cell carcinoma, for example, tends to be a slow growing cancer and rarely spreads to other parts of the body. Despite the fact that this tumor tends to remain localized, studies have shown that delaying treatment for 6 months or longer can lead to a significant increase in the size of the tumor. This means more surgery and a chance for more scarring when the surgery is performed. This could be a consideration given your cancer is on the nose tip. Squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma skin cancers can spread, and should therefore be treated more quickly.&nbsp; I have had a number of patients deay and wait for&nbsp; surgery because of personal commitments. At the same time, if your surgery is straightforward, there is a good chance you will be completely healed by June. The best recommendation I can give is to speak to your Mohs surgeon - he or she can advise you on the best course of action.

	The most common tumor treated with Mohs surgery is basal cell carcinoma. This is typically slow-growing (over months to years) and has nearly no chance of spread to distant parts of the body. For BCC, therefore, a wait of a few weeks for treatment is likely to have no or minimal impact on outcome. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) can also be slow-growing but in some cases can grow quickly and spread beyond the skin. As a general rule, I try and see patients with an obviously growing SCC within 1-2 weeks and try and arrange the surgery if posssible in that time frame as well if the lesion is actively growing or has other concerning pathologic features. If the lesion has been present for many months or even years and is clearly growing slowly there is likely less urgency. In a case like yours if there is any evidence of growth, I would encourage being seen relatively soon to minimize the size of the defect and surgery needed.

	I think your best option is to return to the doctor who performed the Mohs surgery and tell him or her that you&#39;re not happy with the cosmetic result and want to see the best doctor to improve the final result. I would not return to the doctor who performed the repair as I would assume that they did their best by performing the skin graft in this area. Also, it takes 6-12 months to get the final cosmetic result from any surgery, but start by talking to the doctor who removed your skin cancer and referred you to the other surgeon.

	Now, most importantly, you had a skin cancer on your upper lip, and no matter what type of repair or who performs the repair, there will be a scar. It is possible that the result that you have is going to be the best result possible. It is impossible to give an informed opinion over the internet. The doctor needs to examine the area in person and discuss with you what can and cannot be done. Having said that, I&#39;m sure there are a number of excellent surgeons in New York that can help you. Most likely a fellowship-trained Mohs micrographic surgeon or plastic surgeon will have the most experience and training to give you an informed opinion about your best options. Best of luck.

	Mohs&#39; surgery is a method of removal of cancerous tissue in the skin. It is not a method of reconstuction. In nearly all cases, some form of reconstruction is performed to close the wound after the cancer is removed. This can be extremely simple, such as putting in a few stitches, or very complex requiring more than one surgery. Depending upon the reconstruction that is performed, one will expect different results and different after care.

	In any case, your surgeon should discuss with you what is expected and what not to expect after surgery. Anything that is &quot;not expected&quot; should be reported to your surgeon.

	That being said, the following list below constitute a general list of side effects that should not substitute the instructions given to one by their surgeon. These are listed for illustrative purposes only.

	Common expected&nbsp;side effects of any surgery include:

	
		minor bruising
	
		mild pain at the surgical site
	
		mild spotting of blood at the surgical site
	
		mild swelling


	Other side effects that should be reported to one&#39;s surgeon:

	
		allergic reactions to tape and bandages --itching at the site with red rash and/or small blisters
	
		any bleeding
	
		infection--redness, warmth, drainage, discharge
	
		moderate or severe swelling.
	
		Separation of the wound or stitches falling out.

Letting it heal on its own is an option and will leave a round slightly lighter scar in the rough shape of your hole. We can also pull the skin closed with some stitches to give you a straight line scar or broken line scar (this depends on how much loose skin you have and where the tissue laxity allows the hole to be closed easiest). There are benefits to both options of healing on its own vs stitching. For healing on its own, there are no activity restrictions but generally the healing takes longer (6-12 weeks) and the area does not heal as well cosmetically. With stitching, the area heals quicker and generally leaves a better cosmetic outcome. It is not too late to have the area closed up with stitches so you have not lost that option. So it really depends on what my patients prefer but I find that in Stamford and lower Fairfield county area, most of the patients prefer having their wounds stitched closed.

	Mohs surgery remains the best option for treatment of a skin cancer on a hair bearing area.&nbsp; Because Mohs surgery is tissue sparing, the final defect is more likely to be shallower and smaller then with a standard excision yet lead to the complete tumor removal.&nbsp;

	On occasion, shallow wounds on scalp with intact hair follicles are allowed to heal on their own. Since hair follicles are necessary for hair regrowth, the wound is then covered by the newly grown hair. If the depth of the wound was deeper than the location of hair follicles, then the area will be bold unless reconstructed with stitches. However, a form of reconstruction called skin grafting will also result in a bold spot.

	With regards to your current tumor, you may want to ask your surgeon to consider stitching the area to minimize the risk of the bold spot formation. The bold area may also be excised and reconstructed so that you have as little hair loss as possible.

	It is possible that both would work; however, Mohs would work more often. As quoted by Doctor Mamelak, Dan Rowe and colleagues published a number of articles in the late 1980's that looked at the recurrence rate of Mohs, surgical excision, electrodesiccation and curettage and radiation therapy. I believe there were 3 articles, one on primary (not-previously-treated) basal cell carcinoma, another on recurrent basal cell carcinoma and a third on squamous cell carcinoma. The articles were a retrospective study of previous articles describing the treatment success of various modalities for these cancers.

	The chance of recurrence following electrodesiccation and curettage of a recurrent basal cell carcinoma was about 40% (i.e. 60% cure rate). The chance of recurrence following Mohs surgery for a recurrent basal cell carcinoma was about 6% (i.e. 94% cure rate). Recurrent tumors may be more difficult to clear because the tumor cells could be shielded by scar tissue (reason why radiation therapy not as good for recurrent cancers) or the tumor cells could be deeper or separated by normal tissue. In the temple area a branch of the facial nerve called the temporal branch becomes very superficial in the temple. Depending on the location of your skin cancer, if the tumor continues to recur the chance of involvement or injury to this branch of the facial nerve increases.

	In regards to your comment that ...Mohs result(s) in a larger surgical scar... all I can say is that if a defect is larger than you expect after properly-performed Mohs surgery then the cancer must have been larger than expected. Mohs surgery starts with a 1-2 mm margin which is smaller than the margin recommended for standard surgical excision for basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma. If you choose Mohs surgery, I would recommend that you see a dermatologist who has completed a Mohs surgery fellowship and is a member or fellow of the American College of Mohs Surgery.

	Your best option is to discuss your situation with your dermatologist and/or your Mohs surgeon and talk about your particular case. Based on your physical examination, your subtype of basal cell carcinoma, and your concerns, you and your doctor should be able to determine the best treatment for your recurrent skin cancer. Good luck.

	I would recommend you get this evaluated by a board certified dermatologist as soon as possible. Given your story, it may well be a basal cell carcinoma. I understand how frightful this may be to you but delaying it will only make the cancer grow larger. If the dermatologist finds it to be worrisome and biopsies it, and it is a skin cancer, they should refer you to a Mohs and Reconstructive surgeon who can treat it with surgery in a way that minimizes how much skin you lose (take the cancer out and not a lot of normal skin). Make sure this person is a member of the American College of Mohs Surgery and has done a fellowship in Mohs Surgery. Good luck.

	Regardless of having conventional surgery or Mohs surgery, some wounds on the convex part of the scalp do continue to break down and almost heal and then break down again. Eventually, many of these heal, but some need further treatment. If the wound extends down to the bone, it may not heal without further surgical reconstruction.&nbsp; If it is infected, or colonized with significant amount of bacteria or yeast, without infection, it may not fully heal.&nbsp; There are different ways of dealing with wounds. Moist wound care is often helpful with special compresses and antibiotic ointment (there are a few, but you should have your physician prescribe one as the over-the-counter ointments often cause allergic reactions on the skin if used for a many days continually). Sometimes the doctor needs to even inject the wound with medicine. If there is &quot;proud flesh&quot; which is granulation tissue, the protein and blood vessels create a moist red wound that rises over the skin surface and the skin edges can&#39;t migrate over the wound the heal it. In this case the wound is cauterized, often with a chemical in the office. Finally, if there is anything suspicious about the wound&#39;s appearance, cultures or even a biopsy to rule out residual cancer is worthwhile.

	Infiltrative basal cell carcinomas can have small roots that can go much deeper than can be seen with the eye. &nbsp;Curettage frequently cannot treat these roots because the normal collagen surrounding them blocks the curette from being effective. &nbsp;Mohs surgery is the surgical equivalent to taking the bad spot out of an apple. &nbsp;The cancer containing skin is removed and then the edges are evaluated to see if any cancer remains (like looking at the underside of the piece of apple that was removed to see if there is any brown at the edges). &nbsp;If cancer is still at the edge, the surgeon goes back to the exact spot where the cancer still is and takes more until it is gone. &nbsp;You can find an experienced Mohs surgeon through the Mohs College or the American Society for Mohs Surgery.&nbsp;

Radiation is an option with serious downsides and potentially extensive nasal/ facial tissue damage. This is typically recommended for people with unresectable tumors or those who have a high likelihood of not surviving tumor removal and reconstruction.

	The appearance of a scar is ideally &quot;hard to see&quot; or easily camouflaged but this is not always true and depends to a large degree on variables such as the size of the surgery, the type of surgery necessary to repair the defect after the cancer excision, the presence of complications such as infection or bleeding.

	Occasionally patient variables including smoking history, tendency to scar can play a role as well.

6719020,question,,"While there are a number of reasons an area can become red and swollen three months after any surgery, including Mohs. The most likely explanation in your case is that absorbable sutures under the skin have simply not absorbed. While common absorbables such as Vycril are supposed to be absorbed in 28 days, this doesn't always happen. When they are not absorbed on schedule, your immune system will eventually recognize them as foreign and begin to break them down. Eventually, they usually work their way to the surface and exit or spit through to the surface, sometimes marring what had been a nice cosmetic repair. I've seen this happen with Vycril spitting as far out as 6 and 9 months. Because of this, I try to avoid using absorbables on the face whenever it's feasible. Warm moist compresses to the area in continuous fashion will increase blood flow to the area and hasten the response. Unfortunately, going in to remove the absorbables is not a reasonable option. Another possibility is that some tumor was left behind and is starting to grow. All that can be done in this case is to wait for it to surface and be identified. Since retained absorbable suture is the more likely explanation, I don't think it's in your best interest to go in surgically and verify what the problem is.","John Louis Ratz, MD answers: Mohs surgery 3 months ago for basal cell.

	There are many options for treating basal cell carcinoma (BCC) but the cure rate varies greatly amongst these different options. &nbsp;The treatment with the highest cure rate is Mohs surgery. &nbsp;Some other options include curettage and dessication (aka: &quot;scrape and burn&quot;), standard surgical excision (taking blind margins without microscopic control--compared to Mohs you would have larger scar without knowing for sure whether the entire skin cancer was removed or not), chemotherapy agents such as Aldara (imiquimod), cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen), lasers, and radiation. &nbsp;These other methods all have lower cure rates and can be riskier to attempt on the nose. &nbsp;If the BCC were on the body and you chose to use Aldara, there would be a 70% chance that the Aldara would work and if it didn&#39;t, the BCC would come back and possibly bigger for which Mohs surgery would then be indicated for the recurrence. &nbsp;On the back having a bigger scar may not be a big deal but on the nose it could be disastrous if the Aldara didn&#39;t work and the BCC came back even bigger. &nbsp;Your best chance for the smallest scar and the highest cure rate is to have Mohs surgery from the outstart. &nbsp;It&#39;s not possible to know how extensive the BCC is until it&#39;s viewed under the microscope. &nbsp;There are many different options for scar revision after the intiial surgery. &nbsp;I would ask the Mohs surgeon to show you before and after photos of other patients with similar skin cancers on the nose and what kind of repair was done and the final effect.

	Make sure your Mohs surgeon has proper fellowship training and is registered with the American College of Mohs Surgery. &nbsp;The American College of Mohs Surgery (ACMS) is the only organization&nbsp;that requires its members to have successfully completed an extensive one- to two-year ACMS-approved fellowship training program after they have completed their years of residency training. &nbsp;Not all Mohs surgeon are good at doing their own repairs--some have more reconstructive surgery training than others. &nbsp;Some Mohs surgeons do almost all their own repairs and some refer many of their repairs to plastic surgeons. &nbsp;There are some Mohs surgeons who do better repairs than some plastic surgeons. &nbsp;It&#39;s common for a Mohs surgeon to do simple and complex repairs including flaps and skin grafts but to refer to other specialists if the repair becomes particularly challenging (ie: involves cartilage and bone grafting, or possible invasion of the eyeball).

	&nbsp; Mohs can certainly be used for melanoma but when the tissue is frozen for processing, the pigment cells can be distorted making interpretation difficult. There are dermatologists who feel comfortable with this but most use what is termed Slow Mohs. The tissue is excised, divided and color coded as with traditional Mohs. Then the specimen is sent to a lab to be paraffin embedded before examination. This means that the surgery will take more than one day but assures both the dermatologist and the patient that the margins are truly clear.

6669008,question,,"The Cupid's bow area of the upper lip is one of the most difficult areas to repair following a procedure like Mohs Surgery. With so many special borders (2 philtral crests that are elevated, the Philtrum itself, which is depressed and the cutaneous vermillion border, which is multi-curved), it is extremely difficult to obtain a superior cosmetic result. While a skin graft might best fit the bill if the crests still remain, finding a donor site that matches in color and texture may be very close to impossible. If any of the border has been crossed, resulting in a jagged border, normal vermillion would have to be sacrificed to straitenit out and this could lead to an upturn of that portion of the lip resulting in a snarl-like appearance. In order for a flap to work, there is seldom enough tissue in donorsites of the adjacent upper lip and, if there were, the flap placement would very likely obliterate one or both of the philtral crests. Using a vascular based pedical flap from a remote donor site would be a 2-stage procedure with 10 to 14 days between stages and then the color and texture match might pose a problem. And, understand that there is no guarantee that either a graftor a flap will take, particularly if you have a smoking history. Laser resurfacing may soften the look of the border of the graft and the native tissue, but I wouldn't expect more improvement than that.I think you can better understand the difficulty a surgeon faces in considering repair of the Cupid's bow area.

	Being a board-certified facial plastic surgeon (15 years) as well as a board certified dermatologist (10 years), I have had discussions with Moh's surgeons about using Moh's for melanoma. &nbsp;Understand that Moh's surgery allows the surgeon to remove a tumor with taking the least amount of normal tissue and insuring that all of the margins are clear. &nbsp;They do a great job and it certainly has its place. &nbsp;It is my belief that I do not want to be close when I resect a melanoma. &nbsp;I want to have very clear margins and this requires taking more normal skin and going deeper then I might with another type of tumor. &nbsp;So the answer is yes Moh's surgery can be used for resecting a melanoma, but I do not see the value over having it resected with close margins. &nbsp;I always ask the pathologist how clear were my margins. &nbsp;This is an on-going discussion. &nbsp;To date there has been no definitive study that proves that Moh's surgery has any greater success in treating melanoma then frozen sections or a wide resection.

	&nbsp; It certainly cannot be predicted how many passes of Mohs you will require and it will depend on your doctor.&nbsp; Certainly, there is an excellent chance that you will NOT lose facial expression.&nbsp; If you aren't numb, ask the doctor to give additional numbing medication as the only alternative to this would be choosing a doctor who used general anesthesia which is probably not necessary.

	In answer to your questions:

	1. Number of passes/ stages is not completely predictable although smaller tumors tend to require less stages. &nbsp;Our average number of stages is a bit less than 2 so most patients are clear with 1-2 stages, though it's just not perfectly predicable.

	2. You would only lose facial expression in the forehead if either 1) the nerve to the forehead muscle is involved - this nerve is vulnerable mainly in the temple or 2) The removal of the cancer involves a fair amount of muscle. &nbsp;If the tumor is smaller, these possibilities are unlikely (maybe very unlikely) though you should ask your surgeon.

	&nbsp;

	3. Mohs surgeons are very experienced at using local anesthesia. Just make sure that your surgeon knows that you are hard to numb so they can use all of their techniques. &nbsp;I have never had a patient in 15 years that we couldn't numb well.

	Concave areas tend to heal well by secondary intention healing (i.e. allowing the wound to heal by itself). The conchal bowl, that concave area near the external auditory canal (ear canal), frequently heals well by itself. If the area surrounding the ear canal is involved, a graft might be used to minimize scarring around the canal. Fenestration of the cartilage (punching holes in it) is sometimes used to faciliate healing.

	No one can give you an informed opinion over the internet. A specialist should examine the site and discuss what your options are. If you have doubts about the person who performed the Mohs surgery, I would suggest seeking a second opinion. In my opinion, best options would be a Mohs surgeon who has completed a fellowship in Mohs surgery and is a member of the American College of Mohs Surgery (ACMS). You could also see a board-certified plastic surgeon or facial plastic surgeon, just make sure that reconstruction on the ear is something that the particular doctors does on a regular basis in their practice.

2077625,question,,"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Messaging you scar is the best treatment you can do yourself to improve the appearance.  Scars take over a year to remodel and achieve their final appearance.  Applying pressure to them by message helps with the remodeling process and improves their appearance.  The therapy should begin several weeks after the initial procedure when the skin has had a opportunity to close and begin the healing process.  Messaging pressure should be applied to the incision with the aid of any type of lotion to help reduce friction.  You should push hard enough to notice it, but not enough to cause pain.  As you get further out from the procedure, you will not be able to cause discomfort from the pressure and at this time the message therapy will become less effective.  The therapy should happen at least several times a day for the best results.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heating the wound will not really alter the appearance of the scar.  It is effective to make a tight scar and surrounding tissue more pliable to perform therapy on a scar.  Especially if the scar is over a mobile area like a joint.  Gently heat the area and then perform stretching exercises to increase the mobility of the tissues.  Be careful no to apply too much heat to burn the skin especially if the area has no sensation from the procedure and never sleep on heating pads.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If the color is bothering you, the red pigment will fade over time, but again can take over a year to do so.

	A complicated question that only a comprehensive evaluation be a rhinoplasty surgeon can answer. Hopefully, the biopsy is not skin cancer, but MOHS surgery is good option to treat skin cancer of the nose. Some dermatologists may close the open wound immediately after MOHS, while some dermatologists will refer to a plastic surgeon for wound closure. At that point, the plastic surgeon may consider a revision rhinoplasty at the same time as MOHS wound closure, if appropriate.

	Generally, most plastic surgeons do not recommend revision rhinoplasty for at least several months or a year from the first surgery. Speak with your plastic surgeon. Only after a comprehensive evaluation can he/she provide appropriate options for you.

	It sounds like you are going through a lot. If handled well, a wound &quot;healing by secondary intention&quot; or granulation can look decent in this area, but two months is a long time for you to have to deal with it. I agree with the above answers, that polysporin is a likely culprit for causing itching. Itching and irritation caused by an allergic reaction can also slow down wound healing, so do not feel like you should suffer through this just for the &quot;right&quot; treatment. Vaseline or generic petroleum jelly is a very good would healing ointment that also prevents the growth of bacteria on the wound. You should check with your surgeon and see if it is all right to switch.

	Secondarily, the forehead has a lot of nerves of sensation that run through it, so as your skin is realizing it was traumatized, the small nerve fibers that were cut in the surgery are waking up and starting to figure out how to regenerate. This can cause itching, numbness, and funny sensations.

	Keep in touch with your surgeon if you are uncomfortable. It is his job to make sure nothing is wrong.

	You should pick whichever specialist you feel is most qualified, and specifically which doctor in that specialty will give you the best result. Plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons, Mohs surgeons and dermatologists are all qualified to do your surgery; however, some doctors within each of those specialties may be more experienced and more skillful at the particular procedure. My own recommendation would be a fellowship-trained Mohs surgeon who is a member of the American College of Mohs Surgery. Members of the ACMS completed hundreds of skin cancer surgeries during their fellowships, and I think an experienced ACMS-Mohs surgeon in practice for some time after fellowship would be my preference. At the same time a plastic surgeon and facial plastic surgeon would likely give a very good cosmetic result as well, but I would recommend consulting with a Mohs surgeon or perhaps a dermatologist to determine what would be the most appropriate surgical margin necessary for this &quot;malignant&quot; lesion on your lip.

	Being a board-certified facial plastic surgeon (15 years) as well as a board certified dermatologist (10 years), I have had discussions with Moh's surgeons about using Moh's for melanoma. &nbsp;Understand that Moh's surgery allows the surgeon to remove a tumor with taking the least amount of normal tissue and insuring that all of the margins are clear. &nbsp;They do a great job and it certainly has its place. &nbsp;It is my belief that I do not want to be close when I resect a melanoma. &nbsp;I want to have very clear margins and this requires taking more normal skin and going deeper then I might with another type of tumor. &nbsp;So the answer is yes Moh's surgery can be used for resecting a melanoma, but I do not see the value over having it resected with close margins. &nbsp;I always ask the pathologist how clear were my margins. &nbsp;This is an on-going discussion. &nbsp;To date there has been no definitive study that proves that Moh's surgery has any greater success in treating melanoma then frozen sections or a wide resection.

	There are many options for treating your basal cell carinoma. Mohs micrographic surgery will provide the highest cure rate for your type of skin cancer. The cure rate for a previously untreated basal cell carcinoma is approximately 98.5-99%. Mohs surgery will also take out the least amount of healthy tissue around the skin cancer since you start with very thin (i.e. 1 mm) surgical margins. If you pick Mohs surgery, I would recommend picking a fellowship-trained Mohs surgeon who is a member or fellow of the American College of Mohs Surgery. The next treatment option is surgical excision but the cure rate is not quite as high as Mohs surgery and more healthy tissue is sacrificed. The next option is curettage and electrodesiccation (scraping and burning) and again the cure rate is not as high, and frequently the cosmetic result is not as good. Aldara (imiquimod) is a topical medication that might be useful for basal cell carcinomas, and that might be a non-surgical option for you to consider. But the cure rate with Aldara is not nearly as high (probably around 85-90% long-term) either. Radiation therapy is another option. This would require approximately 16-20 treatments with radiation. Cure rate is around 90-93% long term, and while cosmetic result looks pretty good short term, over the long run the treated area tends to appear sunken and the skin thinned out. So there are plenty of options available to consider. See a good dermatologist and talk about your particular situation.

	If you are concerned about a potential skin cancer on the scalp, you should definitely see a dermatologist to determine what it is first. &nbsp;A biopsy of the area will tell you if this is indeed a basal cell or a precancerous growth.

	While freezing with liquid nitrogen and burning (electrodessication and curettage) are both options for skin cancers, I generally do not recommend them for basal cells on the scalp. &nbsp;Using liquid nitrogen to treat a bcc requires significant amount of &quot;freeze time&quot; and recurrence rate is high. &nbsp;Similarly electrodessication and curettage will likely leave you with a bald patch as well.

	Mohs surgery is the most appropriate option in this area. &nbsp;It is tissue sparing-- meaning only the minimium amount of tissue will be removed. &nbsp;If the hair follicles are spared, the hair will likely grow back even if left to heal on its own. &nbsp;If the hair follicles are removed with the surgery, then I would recommend closing the wound with stitches. &nbsp;Most patients have very nice cosmetic results with minimal to no hair loss. &nbsp;

	As in the case of any skin cancer, the top priorities are to ensure the cancer removal and to provide the bet cosmetic outcome. &nbsp; Mohs is the ideal choice since it accomplishes both. &nbsp;

	Best,

	Squamous cell carcinoma in situ are superficial skin cancer that effect the very top layers of the skin. These tumors can sometimes be treated effectively with topical creams, such as imiquimod and 5-fluorouracil, light based treatments like photodynamic therapy, or curettage and electrodesiccation, or a standard surgical excision. When these therapies are used, there is a higher chance of the skin cancer coming back compared to Mohs. Mohs surgery is designed to spare healthy tissue and minimize the amount of surgery required - that's why it's often recommended for areas like the nose tip and other cosmetically sensitive areas. If you are hesitant about undergoing Mohs surgery, I recommend speaking to your physician to see if one of these alternatives might be right for you.

I have personally seen a number of cases where a patient was &quot;cleared&quot; by various methods, yet they had considerable cancer still remaining.  This is especially apparent at the Veteran's Hospital where patients have had considerable sun damage and often present with large or neglected cancers.I also believe that there should a conduit in place for second opinions, or additional interpretations of difficult lesions.  It is arrogant for any one doctor to think they can make a definitive diagnosis by visual inspection alone and not need further opinions on difficult pathologic specimens, especially if they require specialized stains, immunologic testing, etc.  In some cases I have sent pathology specimens to a primary pathologist, our local medical center (UCLA), the Department Chief, and the AFIP (Armed Forces Institute of Pathology), and even specialized world experts such as Dr. Ackerman for melanoma diagnosis.When a difficult lesion occurs, that is where experience and judgment come in.

	There are many alternatives available for treatment of a squamous cell carcinoma in situ on the nose. Mohs surgery would likely give the highest cure rate and will most completely evaluate the surgical margins and conserve the greatest amount of healthy tissue (compared with surgical excision without Mohs). Other options include curettage and electrodesiccation where the tissue is scraped and burned. That would work, but there is a chance that some of the skin cancer may extend down along hair follicles or oil glands and not be reached by the treatment. Topical therapies like imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil may work, but again there is a risk that the treatment may not reach the cancer cells. Your best option is to discuss with your doctor your particular case and discuss your concerns about Mohs surgery. Good luck.&nbsp;

	A biopsy of the lesion is always a pre-requisite for further treatment. This is typically done by a dermatologist.

	If there are no sutures involved and it is healing in on its own (called secondary intention healing) then it may take weeks to months to completely heal.&nbsp; If that is the case, then you want to continue to provide wound care to the area with cleaning it, applying ointment, and a bandage.&nbsp; If you had a graft repair done (such as a porcine graft) then you also may need to continue wound care.&nbsp; If sutures are involved, then typically they are in for approximately two weeks and once they are removed, there is no further care required.&nbsp; Always ask your doctor what instructions they want you to follow and make an appointment if it seems it isn't healing as expected.&nbsp;

4251449,question,,"When a wound which has been sewn up opens, it is called dehiscense, and can be a complication of any type of surgery. When it occurs, the surgeon usually has two options. One of these is to allow the wound to heal on its own. This is called second intention healing. This is usually accomplished by cleaning the wound at least daily, not letting a scab form, and keeping the wound lubricated with an ointment or Vaseline and keeping the wound covered between cleanings. This allows the wound to fill with granulation tissue from the bottom up. When it reaches the top of the wound, new skin will cover the top of the wound from the outside in. The result is a flat and smaller wound then the original one. Letting it open to air will cause a scab to form, preventing the wound from filling with granulation tissue and forcing new skin to form under the scab. This can result in a depressed wound close to the same size as the original.The surgeons second option is to re-close the wound. This is dependent on a number of factors including blood supply, laxity of surrounding tissue, infection, new skin forming over the wound edges, etc. The minimum required prior to re-closing a dehisced wound is to freshen-up the wound edges. This is removing any epidermis which has formed over the wound edges preventing them from attaching to one another.","John Louis Ratz, MD answers: MOHS surgery: incision reopened, will it ever close?",/question/tennessee-tn-mohs-surgery-incision-reopened

381154,question,,"
	The Mohs surgeon whom you see will rely on the pathology report to a) confirm the diagnosis - in this case BCC and b) add information such as type of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) that may influence the outcome.

	With regards to a) confirming the diagnosis. &nbsp;In Seattle, as in other parts of the country, skin biopsies are read by both dermatologists and dermatopathologists. &nbsp;To some degree it depends on the comfort/preference of the dermatologist. &nbsp;Pathology is an important piece of training for dermatologists. &nbsp;BCC in most cases is considered a fairly straightforward pathologic diagnosis and most dermatologists who read their own pathology would be comfortable with this diagnosis most of the time. &nbsp;It is not impossible for there to be a diagnostic error (ie something other than BCC) but I&#39;d guess relatively unlikely in the hands of a good dermatologist. &nbsp;With regards to b), the subtype of BCC does influence both the decision to do Mohs and the anticipated extent of the surgery. &nbsp;In cases where the lesion is in difficult anatomic location like the nasal ala, the subtype of BCC will not be as important as an indication. &nbsp;In other words, on the nasal ala, the anatomic location alone is reason enough to consider Mohs surgery for tissue sparing. &nbsp;Some subtypes of BCC, e.g. infiltrative, would be expected to need a more extensive resection but again, given the location, this doesn&#39;t necessarily change the management and the Mohs surgeon may not feel that information will change what he/she does.

	If you prefer a further comment on the pathology, your options would be:

	1) Ask the dermatologist who did and read the biopsy for more detail

	2) Ask the dermatologist who did the biopsy or the Mohs surgeon who sees you to request that the biopsy specimen be reviewed by a dermatopathologist (who will issue a report).

	3) Ask if the Mohs surgeon wishes to review the slides from the biopsy themselves prior to doing the procedure.

	Given the location on the ala, I&#39;d recommend considering a consultation with the Mohs surgeon prior to any surgery at which visit you can raise these questions.

	Hope that helps.

	Typical recovery depends on the location of the cancer, the size of the defect, what type of reconstruction was required, and whether there are any complicating factors. Most of our patients return the day after surgery at which time the pressure bandage is removed the surgery site evaluated. After that the patient cleans the site twice daily with hydrogen peroxide; applies and antibiotic salve and a non-stick bandage. Sutures are removed for most sites at a week, and by then the site tends to be healing quite well. However, I tell patients that it takes a full 6-12 months to get the final cosmetic result after surgery, during which time we have them use sunscreens and possibly topical silicone gels&nbsp;to further improve the final result.

12559423,question,,"It is impossible to comment intelligently on what you have been told by whoever you spoke to except to say that reconstruction of the lower eyelid takes significant expertise in the surgery and, occasionally, the post operative care so you need to make sure that the surgeon will be available postoperatively. I prefer a Moh's surgeon to remove the lesion so it can be done with the smallest margin possible. You then need a plastic or ophthalmic plastic surgeon to reconstruct, though there are now a very few Moh's surgeons who are properly trained and technically good enough to reconstruct the area depending on the resulting defect and exactly where the lesion is on the lower eyelid. Make sure whoever you choose for the reconstruction has vast experience in reconstructing this area. If everything goes well you can expect a relatively rapid recovery with return to most normal activities within a week. The most common problems are dry eye and persistent swelling. Most good surgeons will use berried sutures that will last at least 6 months for most of the closure and skin sutures that should be left in no longer than 5-6 days.

The color difference may have become more noticeable post-surgery, but nothing in these surgical procedures alters the pigmentation of the abdominal flap or the mons area. I disagree with your plastic surgeon's opinion that the area would clear up, as this may be misinterpreted.

	In this case, it may take a team approach. Depending on the type of malignancy that it is, the best option may be to have a specially trained dermatologist perform Mohs micrographic surgery to remove the lesion and a facial plastic surgeon or plastic surgeon perform the reconstruction.

	Mohs micrographic surgery is a procedure where a specially trained physician, usually a specially trained dermatologist, will remove the lesion in such a way as to be able to examine the borders at the time of the excision. If some tumor remains, additional removal can occur. In this way, the maximum amount of normal tissue is maintained.

	Mohs surgery cannot be performed for all tumors though. Some tumor simply require excision with &#39;surgical margins&#39; - areas of normal tissue removed to ensure that no tumor remains.

	Some Mohs surgeons will be comfortable repairing these defects but at times they will refer patients to plastic surgeons or facial plastic surgeons for repair of the defect that is created. The best surgeon for repair will be the one with the most experience in facial surgery. There are excellent plastic surgeons who perform facial surgery, but then again there are some who perform mostly breast and body surgery, shying away from the face.

	There are many good indications for Mohs micrographic surgery. These include skin cancers with poorly defined clinical margins, skin cancers in locations at higher risk of recurrence or where you would like to preserve the greatest amount of healthy tissue (e.g. nose, eyelids, lips, etc), skin cancers with aggressive histology, recurrent skin cancers, etc. So Mohs would be a good option for a basal cell carcinoma on the nose, but nodular basal cell carcinomas tend to be relatively easily treated and C and D would likely cure this skin cancer. You might discuss the expected cosmetic result in this location... sometimes Mohs and closure heals better than C and D scars. Good luck.

	Surgery near the eyelids and the lips tends to have puffiness for a longer period than other sites. This is related to the delicate lymphatic channels at these sites. It takes time for the lymphatics to recover in these sites and during that time there may be some puffiness. Make sure to follow up with the surgeon to assure there are no other issues, but this problem is likely going to be self limited and resolve in a few weeks to months.

	There are several options here for this type of post MOH&#39;s nasal deformity which I have seen a lot over the years. The best option is to do a filler above the bulge to give the appearance of a natural dorsum using Restylane which is the best HA filler for the nasal dorsum. It will last almost 2 years and by that time the rest of the MOH&#39;s deformity will have settled down in most instances so no further surgery is needed.

	Before anyone discusses revision of a scar for cosmetic reasons, please note that your photograph preoperatively shows a whitish flat spot.&nbsp; This type of basal cell skin cancer is usually an infiltrative type of pattern of growth so it doesn&#39;t look clinically typical and may spread for a wide area. It grows with little strands in different directions underneath the epidermis. In your current photograph, there again, is a white area which may represent scar from some tissue scabbing that you might have had in the acute postoperative period years ago, or this might indicate that there is persistent disease of that basal cell carcinoma.&nbsp; This must be thoroughly explored prior to embarking an revision of the scar.&nbsp; You may need a biopsy, taken appropriately of the right depth to show a pathologist the dermis so as not to get a false negative result if there is not enough tissue to see it.&nbsp; This will leave another scar present on the nose!

	If a biopsy is done and the skin cancer specialist is confident that there is no tumor present clincially and histologically (under the microscope) then a precise scar excision and resuturing may improve the slight groove and mismatch of skin that often occurs in the thick oil-gland rich skin of the nose.&nbsp; This may result however, in a worse scar.&nbsp; Dermabrasion or Fraxel Restore laser done in a series of multiple treatments may improve the texture of the scar significantly.

	As your skin came together from both sides of the nose it made the skin quite tight. Despite some stretching of the skin that develops over time after these closures, the pressure caused the cartilage of the lower nose to bow. You may benefit from a rhinoplasty to build up this profile and support the nasal tip better, especially if a scar revision is done by excision and reclosure that would make this even tighter.&nbsp;

1427623,question,,"Hello!  Thank you for your question!  Numbness after any surgical procedure is expected for several weeks to months following.  As the nerves to the area are traumatized and will then experience a temporary neuropraxia, a transient loss of nerve conduction.  This usually resolves over the next 6-12 weeks, but depending on the procedure performed, sometimes much longer.  Typically this should resolve by 1 year.  As it goes past this date, the likelihood of the sensation returning is small.  However, it can take up to 2 years.  If no return from there, it is unlikely to return.  It should be discussed that persistent sensory changes may develop following any surgical procedure.&nbsp;  It will take up to a year for scars to fully mature.&nbsp; Be patient with the results - continue with scar treatment/scar massage as directed by your surgeon, as well as avoidance of UV light by wearing sunscreen or hat.&nbsp; If after this time the scar is still not to your satisfaction, consideration for scar revision and/or laser, dermabrasion, etc. may be considered.&nbsp; The usual signs of the nerves regenerating and neuropraxia resolving is itching, followed by a burning sensation and then occasional sharp, shock-like pains.  These will be normal to experience, and actually a promising sign.  Usually, normal sensation returns, but is is also possible to have decreased sensation or even increased sensation to the areas affected.  Re-educating nerves postoperatively is often helpful and will allow proper instruction for the affected sensory nerves - methods include using different textures to the affected areas when showering, bathing, applying lotion, etc.  If bothersome, there are some medications that may be helpful, including Neurontin for pain for hypersensitivity.  You can try various textures such as washcloths, loofahs, cotton sheets, etc.  Massaging the areas is also beneficial for the incision to make the finest scar possible.  The last place to regain the sensation will be directly adjacent to the incision/scar as the nerves will make its way from the periphery to this location.  If continual pain arises, evaluation is warranted.  After ruling out other causes, one rare explanation may be that a neuroma has developed and may require surgical excision.  This is very unlikely unless a large sensory nerve has been transected inadvertently during the procedure.  Hope that this helps!

	From the sound of your situation, I would strongly recommend Mohs surgery.&nbsp; Other options, freezing, dessication and curettage, creams, ointments, are usually best for:

	
		Precancerous conditions
	
		Areas that are not cosmetically sensitive
	
		In patients with poor health who are unlikely to survive longer that the cancer grows


	From the sounds of things, you have a cancer blister, which implies invasive disease and the bridge of the nose is obviously cosmetically sensitive.&nbsp; The Mohs procedure is specifically designed to remove the entire cancer (recurrence rates &lt;1%) and save as much normal skin as possible.&nbsp; Further, after Mohs surgery, a good reconstructive facial plastic surgeon should be able to leave you with a result that will keep you on the dating scene.&nbsp; The bridge of the nose is especially forgiving and the scars virtually disappear.&nbsp; I saw a patient today in whom I had repaired a Mohs defect 1 year ago.&nbsp; The&nbsp;scars had so completely disappeared that I couldn&#39;t find where I had done the surgery, and I was the one who made the incisions&nbsp; Using non-surgical treatment has a high risk of not curing the cancer and leaving you with partially treated cancer and an eventual hole that is far larger than what you would end up with if you treat it right the first time.

	Some pieces of advice:

	
		Make sure your dermatologist is Mohs fellowship trained
	
		Make sure your reconstructive plastic surgeon is like-wise fellowship trained
	
		Make sure your Mohs surgeon and reconstructive surgeon is NOT the same person.&nbsp; When the CANCER doctor is the same as the RECONSTRUCTIVE doctor, judgment is compromised.&nbsp; You can&#39;t be thinking about how you&#39;re going to fix it while you&#39;re removing it.

	Glad to hear your skin cancer was removed. Mohs surgeons are trained in the removal of skin cancer while sparing normal tissue and are also experts in reconstructive surgery. No other specialist does as much reconstructive surgery on the face than a busy Mohs surgeon. Once the cancer is out, there are a few options to reconstruct the wound and letting it heal on its own is an option. This option takes several weeks to heal but the advantage is that you are able to resume activity much sooner than if you were to have stitching. The Mohs surgeon you had punched some holes to help stimulate granulation tissue and the wound healing process. Letting it heal on its own can lead to as good if not better cosmetic outcomes in properly selected cases, as Dr. Kaufman mentioned, concave areas do very well. If you are concerned about this, call your Mohs surgeon to let him know, it sounds like you left with some unanswered questions and perhaps he/she can address these for you. You are also welcomed to consult a plastic surgeon if you would feel more comfortable as well, but I echo Dr. Kaufman's comments. Keep in mind that if some sowing is done, you will have some activity restrictions and if you have a skin graft, you would be creating another wound site to cover this one.

11874171,question,,"These would be great questions to pose to your reconstructive oculoplastic surgeon, and perhaps you already have. For the defect you had from the skin cancer, your current result looks excellent, but it is reasonable to inquire as to whether there could be options for the things that you are noticing. Part of the answer depends on how long ago you had surgery. The defect in the skin from the cancer removal has caused some tightening of the eyelid skin below the eyelid margin that is rolling the margin away from the eye in the area of the cancer removal. If the surgery was in the last few months, even if you did nothing, you will still get improvement in the tightness of the tissue and the position of the margin and the bumpiness you notice. Thin or dilute soft tissue filler in very small amounts can be used as a tissue stretcher in the lower eyelid for a small amount of lid retraction. Sometimes this is combined with medications such as 5FU or steroids to modify wound healing. If it has been longer than a year, this may not be as helpful and then you have to consider whether surgery to try to release the skin along the margin leaving an open area to heal with upward traction on the eyelid like a tarsorrhaphy stitch for a week could help, or consider a tiny skin graft. This might help the eyelid roll back up and in, but the cosmetic results of a skin graft are not always predictable, and you could end up with something that you like less than what is there right now. The other issue that alters the appearance of the lid is some lash loss. The absent lashes that were necessary to remove as part of the cancer surgery create a highlight along the lid margin that adds to the perception that more eyelid is showing. Using makeup to camouflage the lash loss would help, or you could consider some delicate tattooing in just that area.","Jill Foster, MD answers: Is it possible to repair bumpy/pulled down lower eyelid margin after mohs reconstruction?

	Puffiness following eyelid reconstruction is not uncommon. It typically resolves by 6 months as lymph flow improves. There are a number of maneuvers you can perform to assist in its resolution; cold compress, massage, head elevation and time.

	I dont typically use steroid injections as they can cause hypopigmentation (white skin) and fat atrophy (hollowing).

	One cause of puffiness around the eye can be redundant orbicularis occuli muscle or sub cutaneous tissue. This will not resolve with expectant observation and may require a debulking procedure. Another cause could be damage to the orbital septum and periorbital fat herniation which also may require a revision. If puffiness doesnt resolve after 6 months you could look into these causes further.

	Make sure you have close follow up with your surgeon and explain any concerns you may have.

	From the sound of your situation, I would strongly recommend Mohs surgery.&nbsp; Other options, freezing, dessication and curettage, creams, ointments, are usually best for:

	
		Precancerous conditions
	
		Areas that are not cosmetically sensitive
	
		In patients with poor health who are unlikely to survive longer that the cancer grows


	From the sounds of things, you have a cancer blister, which implies invasive disease and the bridge of the nose is obviously cosmetically sensitive.&nbsp; The Mohs procedure is specifically designed to remove the entire cancer (recurrence rates &lt;1%) and save as much normal skin as possible.&nbsp; Further, after Mohs surgery, a good reconstructive facial plastic surgeon should be able to leave you with a result that will keep you on the dating scene.&nbsp; The bridge of the nose is especially forgiving and the scars virtually disappear.&nbsp; I saw a patient today in whom I had repaired a Mohs defect 1 year ago.&nbsp; The&nbsp;scars had so completely disappeared that I couldn&#39;t find where I had done the surgery, and I was the one who made the incisions&nbsp; Using non-surgical treatment has a high risk of not curing the cancer and leaving you with partially treated cancer and an eventual hole that is far larger than what you would end up with if you treat it right the first time.

	Some pieces of advice:

	
		Make sure your dermatologist is Mohs fellowship trained
	
		Make sure your reconstructive plastic surgeon is like-wise fellowship trained
	
		Make sure your Mohs surgeon and reconstructive surgeon is NOT the same person.&nbsp; When the CANCER doctor is the same as the RECONSTRUCTIVE doctor, judgment is compromised.&nbsp; You can&#39;t be thinking about how you&#39;re going to fix it while you&#39;re removing it.

Typically, these as well as complications resulting from such procedures are the responsibility of the patient. Procedures that are meant to correct functional issues and those which cause health-related issues should be covered by your insurance as a medical necessity, with proper examination and documentation.  Some insurance plans have exclusion criteria for certain procedures.  Also, it is an obligation of the surgeon not to attempt to authorize purely cosmetic procedures through insurance.&nbsp;  Your rhinoplasty portion should not be covered by insurance as this is a cosmetic procedure, as you state.&nbsp; Depending on what refinements of your nose you will have done as well as you and your surgeon's comfort level for doing the procedure under local anesthesia will determine if you can have it done.&nbsp; But, it is possible.Discuss your issues and complaints with a board-certified plastic surgeon to discuss these as well as to examine and assist you in deciding which procedure(s) will be the best for you. A discussion of the advantages and disadvantages will take place along with the risks and benefits. Insurance companies will vary on coverage and is always reasonable to discuss your issues with your surgeon and primary care.

	I would agree with Dr. Hruza. Best option is to ask your doctor exactly why he is delaying repair of the defect. If the defect is particularly deep or there is exposed bone, he may want to wait for sufficient granulation tissue to develop before placing a graft. The possibility that he is waiting for a final pathology report before repairing is less of a possibility as generally the surgical margins are determined on the same date (exceptions perhaps being some unusual types of skin cancer). Good luck.

	With regard to the first question, continued advances in general anesthesia have continued to improve its safety.&nbsp; However, the majority of reconstructive procedures after Mohs surgery can be performed safely under local anesthesia.&nbsp; Local anesthesia often seems to be the best option with regards to safety, recovery, ability to continue normal diet and medication regimen, and ability to drive oneself to and from the facility after many procedures.&nbsp; Not to confuse the picture further, but an intermediate option we often use is IV sedation...just like the light sedation often given for a colonoscopy, we can utilize sedation to give the patient an additional level of comfort for sensitive areas or more complex cases.&nbsp; With regards to the second question, doctors' preferences for anesthesia are often based on their training and the complexity of a case.&nbsp; As a dual trained Mohs surgeon and board certified Plastic Surgeon, I have experienced both ends of the spectrum.&nbsp; In my plastic surgery training we performed 90% of our cases under general anesthesia.&nbsp; Now, most of the cases were much larger and complex that Mohs reconstruction, and local anesthesia would not be an option for many.&nbsp; When I went on to do my fellowship training in Mohs surgery with a dermatologist, we did 100% of cases under local anesthesia.&nbsp; Of course, only a handful of cases were anywhere near the magnitude of the standard cases performed in plastic surgery.&nbsp; In my current practice, we perform 98-99% of cases under local anesthesia, 1-2% under IV sedation, and maybe 0.1% go under general anesthesia because of extensive cancer growth.&nbsp; Hope this helps!

	As a general rule, wounds heal better and faster when they are kept clean, moist (with a bland ointment) and covered with a non-stick bandage. Wounds that are not kept moist and covered or wounds that are allowed to dry out or scab up will heal more slowly.

	You have a healthy anxiety about the appearance of your nose but surgery wounds and scars take more than a year to improve.&nbsp; Numbness quite commonly improves over time with the onset of tingling or &quot;crawling&quot; sensations that develop over many months.&nbsp; The dorsal nasal advancement rotation flap you seem to have undergone is a very commonly performed reconstruction for nasal tip defects to minimize the distortion of the tip.&nbsp; There is a displacement of skin from the neighboring nasal dorsum and lateral nose that is being used to distribute the tension and minimize deformity.&nbsp; In this way, you will obtain maximal textural and coloration match compared with having had a skin graft (usually taken and completely removed from the skin in front or behind the ear and then sewn into the defect as a patch) which often develops a shinier and whiter skin color with loss of pores.&nbsp; Your flap may benefit eventually with secondary procedures which can help the appearance look better but it is prudent not to rush in and treat early scars.&nbsp; Sometimes, laser resurfacing, massage, special dressings, corticosteroid injections are used to make the flap look better.&nbsp; Follow-up with your surgeon and see what they propose.

	Mohs surgery is&nbsp; procedure named for Dr. Frederick Mohs, who developed this skin cancer removal technique while he was a medical student. Mohs surgery involves removal of a skin cancer by checking microscopic margins to assure complete removal of the tumor while limiting the amount of normal tissue removed. It is commonly used for skin cancers of the nose, eyelid, lip, ear......places where you want to remove the smallest amount of tissue possible and still remove the whole tumor. Once Mohs surgery is performed, the resultant defect (hole) is repaired, usually with a skin graft, skin flap, or sometimes it heals the best without any repair at all.

	Your photos show that the surgeon used a skin flap to repair the defect left in your nose after the skin cancer removal. This flap has caused elevation of the tissue in one area causing a bump, and a depression above the bump where there is scar.

	It doesn&#39;t make any sense to me for you to have a rhinoplasty, since there has been no nasal bone or cartilaginous change to your nose, you just have a soft tissue problem. It also seems overly aggressive to have a &quot;muscle from your scalp&quot; placed. With the large defect you have, I think it would not be advisable to use filler as a first option.

	Although it is hard to tell for sure without examining you, my inclination would be to work on the soft tissue scar, since you were happy with your nose before the Mohs surgery. The flap could be thinned surgically under local anesthesia, possibly steroid injected, and if there was still a deformity superiorly, maybe a little filler could even things out. I agree with your feelings that something&nbsp;&quot;less drastic&quot;&nbsp;should be done.

	This is an odd question. It is difficult to reliably predict how many layers a Mohs procedure will take but if your cancer requires 5 layers then it is usually quite large or deep or both. In general, to take a Mohs layer requires the patient be brought to the operating suite, anesthetized, prepped and then an incision is made to remove tissue.&nbsp; Then the tissue gets processed in the lab which can take a variable amount of time depending on the size of the tissue, how much fat, etc.&nbsp; Then the tissue gets mounted on slides and stained through another tedious process.&nbsp; Finally, the surgeon reads the slides and maps any residual tumor cells and the process is repeated as necessary to achieve clear margins.&nbsp; Following this a fellowship trained mohs surgeon with experinece in reconstructive surgery will then repair the area which again will dpened on how extensive the surgical site is and how complex the repair procedure must be to achieve an optimal cosmetic outcome.

	These wounds are very simple and straight forward to the surgeon but I do see how confusing it can be to the patient. When you are left with a wound to fill in on it's own we call it a healing by secondary intention. The first thing to keep in mind is a dry wound is a dead wound and it will not heal well. I spent one year during my residency training doing research on wound healing and scar management and one thing that was consistent was a clean moist wound heals the best. They way to take care of this wound is to keep it clean with soap and water. Then place antibiotic ointment over a telfa pad, generous amounts, and place it over the wound. Tape this in place. You should change it 3-4 times a day. Wash off the old ointment before applying the new ointment every time. This is very important. The wound will slowly close over time and depending on how big the wound is it can take 4-8 weeks. The wound will contract closed and when it has completely healed you are done. Hope this helps!!

	In general, wounds heal better if they are kept moist and kept covered. I advise my patients to keep ointment such as Vaseline or Aquaphor on their wounds and cover them with bandages such as Telfa. I discourage my patients from airing out their wounds. Wounds exposed to the air actually heal slower than wounds kept covered.

	Historically, this was referred to as Bowen's disease. This refers to intra epidermal squamous cell carcinoma. (This is an actinic keratosis gone bad) Bkz of the superficial nature of this lesion, MOHS surgery is a bit of an overkill. The issue here is that this that this early skin cancer can go down into oil glands and hair follicles and may result in a slightly increased risk of recurrence after non MOHS treatment.

	&nbsp;

	Ask your dermatologist about possible alternative treatments including Aldara, photodynamic therapy, and even aggressive cryotherapy. The nice thing about this disease is that it is low risk and if it comes back, more aggressive treatments can be used.

	The first option in many cases is to close the wound by your Mohs surgeon that day.&nbsp; If the defect is large and the skin tight, sometimes you can allow for healing slowly over 4-6 weeks to close the area. This then can be later closed if needed as the wound will be at least 20% smaller if not more.&nbsp; This requires patience on your part. Sometimes it heals so good on its own that revision is not&nbsp;even needed but this may be more true in other areas rather than the mid forehead. &nbsp;A skin graft on the forehead is almost always a poor choice for cosmetic outcome and so a local flap or linear closure is often used in these cases.&nbsp; Since you did not send a picture, just keep checking in with your Mohs surgeon and come up with a plan that makes the most sense as you see how it heals on its own over time.

	First off, don&#39;t lose hope. There is a good chance some of that hair will grow back. It&#39;s difficult to tell what type of repair was done, but sometimes surgery on the scalp can induce telogen effluvium. What happens is that some of the hairs are put in shock, actually they&#39;re put in a sleep state. These sleeping hair follicles are the ones that we normally shed every day.So you shed an increased&nbsp;number of hairs in the area. &nbsp;If that&#39;s the case, the hairs will start to regrow about 3-6 months after surgery. Rogaine wouldn&#39;t hurt, but Rogaine mainly works for male or female pattern hair loss and not telogen effluvium and not other reasons for hair loss.

	Insurance plans allow a predermination letter to be sent by the doctor to a medical reviewer within the insurance company. &nbsp;This letter (accompanied by photos) would describe the anatomic problem and cancer history as well as the proposed surgical manoevers. &nbsp;Often times in your situation insurance plans will cover reconstructive procedures to address scarring and disfigurement.

	Other areas of your nose that you separately have always wanted to enhance/change would be considered cosmetic non-insurance covered procedures.

	The good news is that if the insurance company decides to cover your scar revision, then the cost for additional cosmetic procedures may be less since the insurance company is already covering a portion of the cost for the operating room and the anesthesia.

	Speaking of anesthesia- rhinoplasty is almost never performed under local. &nbsp;There are just too many invasive manoevers that would be too much for a patient under local. &nbsp;Either &quot;twilight sedation&quot; or general anesthesia is typically utilized for rhinoplasty.

8633679,question,,"Basically the site wasn't fully healed when the stitches dissolved. Sometimes this happens, which is why I don't personally like only dissolvable stitches, but will nearly always put in a regular stitch or two as well. On the nose it can be very hard to close the site and keep it closed. Some surgeons will opt for healing by secondary intention which is where specific steps are followed and the site will cover over and close up by itself. The key is that you have to keep the area very clean, moist, and well gooped up. You do not want it to get scabs or crusts on it. If you are concerned or don't know what to do, I'd follow up with your surgeon. If you can follow the protocols and cleaning steps it will heal up just fine.This answer has been solicited without seeing this patient and cannot be held as true medical advice, but only opinion.

	Skin grafts require a complete blood supply to &quot;take&quot; and live. &nbsp;Sometimes for a variety of reasons there is some compromise of the blood supply and the grafts don&#39;t completely take. &nbsp;It is not necessarily an all or nothing phenomenon and the graft may be partially taken. &nbsp;In many cases, the wound is allowed to heal &nbsp;and then decisions about whether any further touchups or surgery may be helpful can be made. &nbsp;Revisions down the road can involve further surgery sometimes or more simpler interventions like laser or dermabrasion. &nbsp;It is quite common for a wound (either post surgery or allowed to heal on its own) to look depressed, off color and improve dramatically with time.

	It is not possible to tell completely if there is partial take of your graft from the photo, though that is certainly possible. Skin grafts can have a variety of appearances in the immediate week or two after surgery. &nbsp;Many, including me, do believe that &quot;moist&quot; wound healing, e.g. with Vaseline helps speed healing.

	&nbsp;

	The final decision on when and whether to intervene and possibly revise the scar is ultimately based on how its healing and the input of both the surgeon and the patient. &nbsp;I&#39;d recommend following up with the reconstructive surgeon (the oculoplastic surgeon) for his/her input.&nbsp;

1427656,question,,"Hello!  Thank you for your question!  Numbness after any surgical procedure is expected for several weeks to months following.  As the nerves to the area are traumatized and will then experience a temporary neuropraxia, a transient loss of nerve conduction.  This usually resolves over the next 6-12 weeks, but depending on the procedure performed, sometimes much longer.  Typically this should resolve by 1 year.  As it goes past this date, the likelihood of the sensation returning is small.  However, it can take up to 2 years.  If no return from there, it is unlikely to return.  It should be discussed that persistent sensory changes may develop following any surgical procedure.&nbsp;  Unless the procedure was a skin graft, sensation will likely return.The usual signs of the nerves regenerating and neuropraxia resolving is itching, followed by a burning sensation and then occasional sharp, shock-like pains.  These will be normal to experience, and actually a promising sign.  Usually, normal sensation returns, but is is also possible to have decreased sensation or even increased sensation to the areas affected.  Re-educating nerves postoperatively is often helpful and will allow proper instruction for the affected sensory nerves - methods include using different textures to the affected areas when showering, bathing, applying lotion, etc.  If bothersome, there are some medications that may be helpful, including Neurontin for pain for hypersensitivity.  You can try various textures such as washcloths, loofahs, cotton sheets, etc.  Massaging the areas is also beneficial for the incision to make the finest scar possible.  The last place to regain the sensation will be directly adjacent to the incision/scar as the nerves will make its way from the periphery to this location.  If continual pain arises, evaluation is warranted.  After ruling out other causes, one rare explanation may be that a neuroma has developed and may require surgical excision.  This is very unlikely unless a large sensory nerve has been transected inadvertently during the procedure.  Hope that this helps!

	3 month is a very short time.&nbsp; Indentation you see may be more noticable while there is still surrounding swelling and as it subsides, you may not need any additional surgery.

	I would wait till 6 month after surgery and then discuss with your MOHS surgeon options for revision if needed and any contraindications based on the type of cancer removed.&nbsp; There are some studies showing better survival of patients with advanced melanoma and decreased recurrence if the wound heals by secondary intention.

	It is very common to get swelling in the skin close to the site of a surgery. The eyelid has some of the thinnest skin in the body. The swelling in this area can therefore be more prominent, as the thicker structure of the surrounding skin can better contain swelling. In fact, swelling can often collect around the eyelid when surgery is performed on the forehead, temple or cheek. In general, swelling around the eyelid resolves within the first week after surgery. Keeping your head up and sleeping with an extra pillow at night are good ways to help speed the resolution of the swelling. If you have any questions or concerns, you should always contact your surgeon for instructions and/or reassurance.

	First off, kudos to you for using a Mohs surgeon to treat a skin cancer on a cosemtically sensitive area.&nbsp; As stated before, make sure that you are using a fellowship-trained Mohs surgeon.

	Personally, I do not like to leave defects on the nasal tip to heal by secondary intention.&nbsp; I feel that this leaves an unacceptable scar.&nbsp; There are other locations were secondary intention healing is acceptable (concha of ear, small medial canthal defects), but I do not consider the nasal tip one of these.

	Depending on the size of your final defect, there are several repair options.&nbsp; If your defect is midline on the nasal tip, your surgeon may be able to close it primarily (in a straight line).&nbsp; If that is not feasible, then you are looking at a skin flap (moving around adajcent skin) or a skin graft.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not a big fan of grafts on the nasal tip unless it is really small and shallow.&nbsp;

	Your best option is to discuss the situation with the plastic surgeon who performed the repair.&nbsp;It's hard to make an educated guess or give any opinion as to what happened or possibility of recovery without knowing exactly what procedure was performed. The plastic surgeon knows what he/she performed and what might have happened. There is a branch of the facial nerve (cranial nerve 7) that is known as the temporal nerve. This nerve becomes superficial in the temple area and can be injured, causing eyebrow drooping on the effected side. It's possible a distal branch may have been traumatized.

1427638,question,,"Hello!  Thank you for your question!  Numbness after any surgical procedure is expected for several weeks to months following.  As the nerves to the area are traumatized and will then experience a temporary neuropraxia, a transient loss of nerve conduction.  This usually resolves over the next 6-12 weeks, but depending on the procedure performed, sometimes much longer.  Typically this should resolve by 1 year.  As it goes past this date, the likelihood of the sensation returning is small.  However, it can take up to 2 years.  If no return from there, it is unlikely to return.  It should be discussed that persistent sensory changes may develop following any surgical procedure.  The usual signs of the nerves regenerating and neuropraxia resolving is itching, followed by a burning sensation and then occasional sharp, shock-like pains.  These will be normal to experience, and actually a promising sign.  Usually, normal sensation returns, but is is also possible to have decreased sensation or even increased sensation to the areas affected.  Re-educating nerves postoperatively is often helpful and will allow proper instruction for the affected sensory nerves - methods include using different textures to the affected areas when showering, bathing, applying lotion, etc.  If bothersome, there are some medications that may be helpful, including Neurontin for pain for hypersensitivity.  You can try various textures such as washcloths, loofahs, cotton sheets, etc.  Massaging the areas is also beneficial for the incision to make the finest scar possible.  The last place to regain the sensation will be directly adjacent to the incision/scar as the nerves will make its way from the periphery to this location.  If continual pain arises, evaluation is warranted.  After ruling out other causes, one rare explanation may be that a neuroma has developed and may require surgical excision.  This is very unlikely unless a large sensory nerve has been transected inadvertently during the procedure.  Hope that this helps!

	Scar treatment ointment can be as simple as petroleum jelly. Studies have shown that cosmetic scar creams and vaseline had the same cosmetic outcome when used half on each side of a long straight scar.&nbsp; That said, vasline cost 2$ while other scar treatment ointments cost 10-40$. Also be reminded that the antibiotic ointments also did not show an advantage over petroleum jelly when it came to infections in a large study. So my advice to my patients is to save your money and apply a petroleum based jelly immediately after surgery and daily until the sutures are removed then 1-3 days after so that final healing can occur.&nbsp; Always keep the area covered so the air does not get to it untile the sutures are removed and it is fully healed.&nbsp; This will optomize your outcome.&nbsp; The old wives tail of scabbing is healing or let the air get to it just doesnt stand up to the science of wound healing in a clean moist covered environment.

	Lips can be an unforgiving location to repair after skin cancer removal because they are a free margin. This means that any amount of tension of the lip can cause it to pull up or down because there is no support to keep the lip in place.

1778896,question,,"This is an extremely common problem. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer. The nose is an extremely common location, due to the amount of sun exposure one gets there. There are several types of basal cell carcinoma. The infiltrative type grows as little fingers that weave between the collagen fibers. Therefore, treatment can be difficult. Mohs' Surgery would be the best option for removing this tumor, with the least risk of recurrence. Alternatively, radiation could be considered, although this would be slightly inferior in terms of recurrence rate.As far as reconstruction goes, there are always options. Typically, forehead flaps are used for very large tumors that are on the lower part of the nose (the tip). Use of this flap on the bridge is not common. There are always other options, including local flaps, skin grafts, and the option to let it heal in by itself. I recommend that you discuss all of these options with your surgeon, or get a second opinion regarding the reconstruction after Mohs'.&nbsp;","Robert S.

	Normally, nasal tip defects are reconstructed by either a skin flap which involves movement of adjacent skin to cover the area, or a skin graft which is a patch of skin removed from a separate area such as behind or in front of the ear, side of the neck or other donor areas from the same patient. Otherwise, nasal defects on such a convex area of the tip of the nose typically do not heal with appropriate aesthetic outcomes. The underlying cartilage may be too noticable as bumps and the scar tissue may be too thin. All of this depends on the depth of the wound as it is possible to consider healing without stitches if the wound is shallow.

	First of all,&nbsp;are you seeing a board certified and fellowship-trained Mohs surgeon. You can tell by going to Mohscollege.org and look up your doctor. Next, you should know that this surgical decision can only be determined after the Mohs layers show no residual cancer cells and the depth of the area is known.&nbsp; Sometimes these &quot;small&quot; cancers can be tiny or be just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; Lastly, your fellowship-trained Mohs surgeon is required for certification to have extensive experience with reconstruction. So they will be able to tell you if a skin graft , a local flap, a linear closure , or healing without stitches is best.&nbsp; In general, the nose tip is rounded and is not prone to ideal healing without stitches whereas the creases of the nose would do much better without stitches.&nbsp; Rest assured, that if stitching is needed this will cut down your healing time by up to 3 weeks as compared to leaving it open to heal on its own. Lastly, be aware that every wound can and will heal without any stitches, but if ideal cosmetic outcome is of concern then discuss this with&nbsp;your Mohs surgeon.

	Scar treatment ointment can be as simple as petroleum jelly.

Also be reminded that the antibiotic ointments also did not show an advantage over petroleum jelly when it came to infections in a large study. So my advice to my patients is to save your money and apply a petroleum based jelly immediately after surgery and daily until the sutures are removed then 1-3 days after so that final healing can occur.&nbsp; Always keep the area covered so the air does not get to it untile the sutures are removed and it is fully healed.&nbsp; This will optomize your outcome.&nbsp; The old wives tail of scabbing is healing or let the air get to it just doesnt stand up to the science of wound healing in a clean moist covered environment.

1363554,question,,"When I have a Mohs patient who pays cash, I usually estimate between $1500-$2500 depending on the location, size, and approximate number of layers I think I will need to do. Mohs can be hard to estimate simply because as doctors what we are trying to do is minimize the amount of tissue removed, and preserve as much as possible for cosmetic results. This means we sometimes end up chasing a root of cancer that we didn't know was there underneath, and so it's hard to tell a patient that there were so many more levels needed than expected. Mohs is hard to estimate for this reason. With that being said, I think your price is reasonable and I'm glad you are going to a Mohs board-certified physician. If you are worried about costs, you could look into funding through CareCredit, assuming your physician takes it. It allows patients to receive medial care and can allow for up to 3 years of no-interest financing. It's good for people who will have big expenditures but don't want to tie up credit cards. You can apply online or over the phone, and it's very simple. But again, make sure your physician takes it!

	There is no question that general anesthesia has its place when doing larger reconstructive surgeries or for patients who simply cannot sit still for the reconstruction.&nbsp; However, when doing a graft in any patient at any age, general anesthesia is typically not warranted unless there is a very large site that requires repair (in which&nbsp;it would be potentially unsafe to use larger quantities of local anesthesia).&nbsp;

	The beauty of Mohs surgery is that both the removal of the cancer&nbsp;and the reconstruction of the defect can&nbsp;be done safely in an outpatient setting using local anesthesia.&nbsp; This limits costs, is less stressful for the patient (one day of surgery rather than two), and is often safer as the risk of general anesthesia is greater than local.&nbsp; Most Mohs surgeons do have access to use of the operating rooms at hospitals but choose to do their reconstructions in their own offices for the reasons above.&nbsp;

	It is true that the swelling in the mons pubis area is the last part to go down following tummy tuck, and the swelling here lasts even longer when liposuction is done at the same time. Whether or not this will still go down depends how long it has been from the time of surgery. Often patients do not notice mons fullness since the tummy hangs over it or is in the way of viewing it from above, but no additional tissue is put there during a tummy tuck or liposuction. The most common reasons for a large mons after surgery is a large mons before surgery, and normal postoperative swelling. If you have concerns, that is the time to make an appointment with your surgeon, even if it is just for reassurance that the healing is progressing normally.

3220199,question,,"Ido quite a bit of closures for a Mohs surgeon in town here in Arizona. It is impossible for me to know what sutures were put beneath the skin if any without the operative note. Being that said, it is standard to put what we as plastic surgeons call deep dermal sutures then interrupted skin sutures externally like you have. Certainly a hematoma creates an angry environment for the wound and scar whereby the scar becomes very firm and swollen for several months. It will calm down over time. Ido not usually revise scars for one year because it takes that long for scars to completely heal.They will remodel from 6 weeks up to month 12. That is well documented in the literature. In that time period the scars will fade, become flatter and overall just look better. Everyone scars different so even the perfect closure may not look great on one person but perfect on another person. If I were you I would let this thing go for at least 6 months to allow the scar to calm down and soften and then maybe visit a plastic surgeon or your dermatologist if you trust them to look at it again. But, if Iwere you I would not try to revise this scar any longer until some time has passed to allow it to heal. It takes a LONG time so you have to be patient. It will not look good overnight or even in a couple months. And, by the way the puckering is usually from placement of the deep dermal sutures and goes away after several months when the sutures dissolve beneath the skin. That is when it flattens out.

	Depending on the size and location of the surgical defect, second intention healing can give a better cosmetic result than having reconstructive surgery. &nbsp;However, it is not appropriate in all cases. &nbsp;

	If matching the adjacent skin is a concern, a flap or complex closure depending on the size and location of the nasal defect will give a better match to the adjacent nasal skin. The level of care required will be greater with the flap, but the aesthetic results after it has completely healed will be worth it. &nbsp;

	If you decide to let the wound heal on it&#39;s own and you are not satisfied with the final outcome, a revision procedure can be planned with your reconstructive surgeon.

5535043,question,,"Skin of the scalp can be very tight and closure of a large defect may be very difficult. Without having more information, it appears that this was a large defect that was closed primarily. This can result in so much tension on the wound that the tissue begins to necrose(die).Such necrotic tissue can heal over time with proper wound care. I suggest having a culture done to see if an oral antibiotic is needed. If so, this should be done. Wound care does not have to be complicated by all the stuff you're applying. First of all, the necrotic tissue should be debrided under local anesthesiaby your doctor. Wound care should then consist of cleaning the wound of any clear yellow or milky yellow liquid exudate that develops with sterile normal saline on gauze pads or cotton-tipped applicators. These should be used to firmly rub away any debris or yellow liquid.Once cleaned, petroleum jelly(Vaseline) should be used to cover the wound, followed by a non-adherent dressing such as Telfa followed by gauze pads to soak up any discharge or oozing. this should then be secured with tape or a wrap dressing such as Coban(also available and less expensive as Vet-Wrap). The wound care should be done twice daily initially. Proper healing is taking place when islands of granulation tissue can be seen. Granulation tissue is rich in blood vessels and resembles the flesh of watermelon. Granulation tissue will eventually fill the wound and drainage is then decreased allowing wound care to be decreased to once a day. Wound cleaning should be gentle at this point. Once granulation tissue fills the wound to the level of normal skin, new epithelium(first layer of skin) will form from the outside in. New epithelium is quite fragile and wound cleaning should be limited to gently touching the healing portions of the wound and no rubbing with the gauze pads or cotton-tipped applicators.If I am correct about what is going on, radiation therapy should not be started until the wound is completely healed which, for this wound, could take six or more weeks. Radiation treatment at the point the wound is currently at could not just delay healing, but stop it all together. You might also want to get a second opinion from another Mohs surgeon.","John Louis Ratz, MD answers: Mohs surgery: vertex incision dissolvable stitches still oozing, what should I do?

236883,question,,"
	Dear Ariela,

	The pubic area may &#39;become larger&#39; after tummy tuck for a variety of reasons.

	If you notice that it is &#39;higher&#39;, it may be due to elevation of the mons area. The mons area becomes elevated in most tummy tucks to some degree. If you had a sagging mons area, the lifting can produce a significant difference in the appearance which may be a &#39;normal appearance&#39;. If you did not have a sagging mons area, the tummy tuck can lift it&nbsp;higher than desired. This can be controlled by making the initial tummy tuck &nbsp;markings lower down on the mons area.&nbsp; Over time, the incision tends to drift downwards to some degree; you are 6 weeks post surgery and it will be many months before this settling is complete.

	If you notice that the area is &#39;fuller&#39;, it may be due to post operative swelling or residual fat in the mons. In the first few months, it is not unusual for the mons to be fuller due to swelling; fluid tends to collect in the lowest part of your abdomen because of the effects of gravity. This corresponds to the lower abdomen and mons area. Give it some time and the swelling will improve. If you had a fatty mons area prior to surgery, the mons has been lifted, and the tummy tuck has given you a flat tummy; the fatty mons might be more noticeable now.&nbsp;This can be corrected&nbsp;with some liposuction at the time of the surgery, or afterwards.&nbsp;

	At this point in your recovery, you&nbsp;may&nbsp;have normal post op changes&nbsp;&nbsp;I recommend you discuss this issue &nbsp;with&nbsp;your surgeon, and wait for the things to settle.

	Best regards,

	Lawrence Tong MD FACS FRCSC

	Your story raises a couple of questions.&nbsp; Many surgeons will tie a bolster dressing over a skin graft and leave for a week (or longer).&nbsp; This becomes a bit soiled over the time and hard and can look like drying out skin.&nbsp; Ocassionally a patient will lose this dressing and assume it&#39;s the graft.

	Alternatively it is possible that the graft had an infection or poor blood supply and did have a partial or complete NON-Take , that is it didn&#39;t get enough blood to live.&nbsp; This can lead to a depressed scar and may require revision.

	Since there are a few possibilities, it is not possible to give a final answer.&nbsp; This one would be best dealt with in person with your MD

	Squamous cell skin cancers can be treated with simple excision, Mohs surgery (tissue sparing surgery), a scrape &amp; burn procedure (ED&amp;C) and in some cases, freezing with liquid nitrogen. The excision procedures (simple excision and Mohs) will tend to leave linear scars whereas the scrape &amp; burn tend to leave flat whitish scars. A linear scar in the long run may be less noticeable than a flat white scar. If your squamous cell skin cancers are superficial, they may respond well to topical therapeutic agents including 5-Fluorouracil or Aldara which would be ideal since scarring would be minimal with these nonsurgical treatments. It is not appropriate, however, to treat invasive squamous cell skin cancers with creams.

2013654,question,,"&nbsp;Your concern is only natural, especially because the end result cannot be predicted pre-operatively. There are 2 nerves that arise near the central part of your brow. If these are damaged, there will be numbness heading up your forehead to your scalp. The good news is that if there is nerve damage, it is almost always temporary. It could take up to a year for the feeling to come back but there would be no change in your appearance. Near the lateral aspect of your brow there is another nerve that controls the ability to raise your brow. In the unlikely event that nerve is damaged, your brow could droop on that side. Again, it may be temporary if the nerve is simply injured from stretching or other insult (neuropraxia). If permanent (again unlikely), the brow can very easily be put back in a normal position with sutures. The concept of a flap may sound frightening but Mohs surgeons perform them daily.

	Skin grafts may form a scab on the surface and the deeper part of the graft may be living when the surface comes off. Some grafts lose the dead skin cell layer in sheets without it being a dead graft, but the dead cells that normally flake off every day, and can&#39;t be seen, can accumulate under the dressing and peel off after a graft without injury to the graft.&nbsp; If the whole graft forms a hard scab, it&#39;s rare to fall out unless it is traumatically pulled. Cover the wound with a bandaid and call your doctor to be seen and determine how they want you to take care of the wound. Some of these wounds heal fine without additional surgery and sometimes a new graft is done several weeks later after healing allows the wound to fill in as much as possible.

	Mohs surgery is a highly specialized in-office procedure for treating skin cancer. The procedure involves removing a tumor, layer-by-layer, down to its root, while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. Every time a layer of skin tissue is taken, the tissue is processed in an onsite lab and examined under a microscope. Therefore, the Mohs procedure really has 2 steps: the surgery itself, and the processing in the lab.

	The surgery is quite quick. It usually takes about 5 minute to remove a layer of skin tissue. The lab processing, however, usually takes a longer duration of time. Depending on the clinic, this could take 30-60 minutes per layer of tissue. The number of layers required is variable, and really depends on the roots and growth pattern of your cancer. One average, 1-2 layers are required. Because the time involved in the procedure is somewhat unpredictable, I often tell patients to block a half day, wear comfortable clothing, bring a book, laptop, spouse or friend to help pass the time.

	Yes you can have revision rhinoplasty following Mohs excision. Depending upon the size of the defect you would need to wait 6-12 months. With that said, most Facial Plastic Surgeons will recommend waiting another 9 months (full year following rhinoplasty) before pursuing a revision procedure. This would also depend upon where the skin lesion is located and what portion of your nose you would like addressed with the rhinoplasty revision. If the lesion is on the nasal tip and you want the bridge lowered, you would have to wait a shorter period of time. The first step is to get your nasal lesion biopsied. If that is a basal cell carcinoma you'll want to pursue Mohs. An ignored skin cancer just gets bigger which will jeopardize more of your nasal skin. I hope this information is helpful.

I tell patients to keep any removal sites clean and free from scabs and to apply either Polysporin or Vaseline liberally to keep it moist.

	There are many ways to treat skin cancers. There are also 4 different types of squamous cells all of which can be managed differently. As a starting point, Mohs surgery offers the highest cure rates of all the options available. So if cure is your goal this may make the most sense. In addition, if you do elect for a surgical procedure then Mohs surgery has been shown to conserve 180% more tissue than standard surgery and so will leave the smallest area to sew and hence a smaller scar.&nbsp; These are just quoting the literature but each patient and each cancer needs to be decided upon by the patient and the doctor. Some of the more superficial squamous cell cancers are sometimes managed with scraping and burning or even creams but again you need to know the real cure rates, risk of&nbsp;scarring, risks and benefits etc &nbsp;for these before deciding and this can all be provided by your dermatologist.

Its a surgery meant in more complicated cases. Instead I would have preferred to correct the dark marks surrounding your eyes, the holowness, the prominent nasojugal line and the broad jawline in your case.

13245844,question,,"Firstly, congratulations on your significant weight loss; that's a commendable achievement. Addressing your concerns, it's not uncommon for significant weight loss to result in loose skin in various areas, as you've described.In your case, combining an extended tummy tuck, breast lift, and pubic lift (mons lift) in one surgical session can be possible, depending on several factors:Overall Health: Your overall health and medical history are critical in determining your suitability for multiple procedures at once. Your surgeon will assess whether your body can safely handle the combined stress of these surgeries.Surgical Complexity: The extent of the loose skin and the complexity of each procedure will be considered. Sometimes, it's safer and more effective to stage these procedures rather than doing them all at once.Mons Pubis Concerns: A well-performed extended tummy tuck can include addressing the mons pubis area. This procedure can remove excess skin and fat from the lower abdomen and mons pubis, potentially reducing bulging.Inner and Upper Thighs: Loose skin on the inner and upper thighs might require a separate procedure, known as a thigh lift. This is typically not done in the same session as an extensive abdominoplasty and breast lift due to the length of the surgery and the recovery considerations.It's essential to have a detailed consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon. They can provide a personalized plan based on your body's needs and your aesthetic goals. They will evaluate the areas of concern, discuss potential outcomes, and plan the procedures in a way that maximizes safety and effectiveness. The surgeon's priority will be to balance achieving the desired aesthetic result with ensuring your health and safety throughout the process.","Aaron Gilson, DO answers: Can you get a breast lift, extended tummy tuck and pubic lift at the same time?",/question/sacramento-california-breast-lift-extended-tummy-tuck-pubic-lift-time

5956163,question,,"Thanks for the question. The answer is it depends. Upper eyelid surgery or blepharoplasty with skin excision only (the majority of cases) is a relatively easy recovery with most patients completely recovered at two weeks. The sutures are typically removed within the first week. Upper eyelid surgery involving more than just skin removal (fat grafting or removal) may involve a slightly longer recovery time. Lower eyelid surgery (lower blepharoplasty) typically involves a longer recovery time with more bruising and swelling. A transconjunctival approach does not involve any external incision but may have more bruising and swelling. A more innovative approach with fat grafting and laser resurfacing only may have a shorter recovery time. Depending on the approach, most patients are completely recovered from lower blepharoplasty surgery at 4 weeks.

135203,question,,"Although I agree with other posts which state that healing by secondary intention of a Moh's defect is sometimes appropriate, it is generally in the minority of situations.  The reason for this is that nasal skin is thicker and more sebaceous than other area of the face. In addition, it is supported by relatively flexible underlying cartilaginous structures. Healing via secondary intention on the nose relies on wound contraction which can lead to distortion of varies nasal subunits, and a mismatch in nasal topography.  The other factor is the time involved; this form of healing can take months.I almost always use some form of skin flap (usually a bilobe flap) which replaces both the skin and underlying muscle of the nasal defect.  This allows for a texture and thickness match not allowed for by skin grafts and healing via secondary intention.  For larger nasal defects, a more advanced flap (paramedian forehead flap) is sometimes employed.  Due to the downtime associated with this flap, some patient elect to have simpler reconstructive options.  However, the aesthetic results from this flap are typically excellent.","Stephen Prendiville, MD answers: What happens to Mohs surgery scar when healed by itself?",/question/Mohs-surgery-scar-healing

	Most often we recommend Mohs because some cancers can have a form of roots, which run deeper and wider under the skin layers. Using a topical treatment like Aldara/Zyclara cannot get to these roots. So even if you use it and the top of the skin appears better, the deeper roots and layers can still be effected by the BCC and can continue growing and expanding. This is why it&#39;s not recommended for this type of cancer.

	Second, the purpose of Mohs is to take as minimal amounts of skin out as possible. That&#39;s why slides are made during the procedure so your doctor only has to take out the affected, cancerous areas. Thus, you will be left with the most minimized scar possible. Mohs is your best option here, and trying Aldara/Zyclara will only delay and possibly worsen what needs to be taken out.

	Your symptoms are unusual following skin cancer surgery, whether by Mohs or standard surgical excision. The exact cause is unclear. It could be a medication reaction, infection or could be something unrelated to your surgical procedure.

	You should see your physician and have them examine you. If they cannot determine the cause, I would recommend you see another physician, such as an otorhinolaryngologist (ENT doctor). Good luck.

	Full thickness skin grafts are a common method of repairing surgical defects after Mohs surgery. They definitely improve aeshetically with time, with most grafts continuing to mature for 6-24 months. However, at our center, we treat many of these grafts (and other surgical scars) with fractional resurfacing lasers. This greatly improves both the color and texture of the graft scar. Laser treatment can be initiated wihtin a month after the surgical procedure.

	Once Mohs surgical excision is performed most Mohs surgeons then place a skin graft as a temporary fix to get the wound healed and a consultation can be obtained from a Plastic Surgeon. This should be uniformly true for cancers in delicate and complex areas of the face such a the nose or lips. Cosmetic reconstruction of the lip is complicated and usually involves complete removal fo the skin graft and transposition of available adjacent cheek tissue to replace the entire quadrant of the lip while trying to match the opposite normal side of the lip. There have been textbooks written on the subject but&nbsp; very few non-Plastic Surgeons are exprerienced in these operations.

12627278,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding how you can get your goal results of a defined waist, fuller, rounder butt/hips, mons reduction, and breast augmentation. Let's start with your abdomen: you have excess skin and excess fat. If you remove the fat with liposuction, you'll be left with even more excess skin. VASER Hi-Def liposuction is great at contracting the skin a little. But it will likely not tighten your abdomen enough. Therefore, I recommend a tummy tuck. Looking at your mons region, you have excess skin and fat. This can be addressed during the tummy tuck. I recommend you stage these procedures. In stage 1, liposuction of the abdomen, love handles, back, and mons with fat transfer to the buttocks (BBL). 3-4 months later, you can come back for stage 2, tummy tuck and breast augmentation. If you want an hourglass figure, I would recommend a high-lateral tension tummy tuck. The incision will start above the pubic region and then carry out over your hips. Please make sure your chosen plastic performs muscle plication (during the tummy tuck). This will bring in your waistline by about 2-6 inches.I hope this helps answer your question about what procedures you should follow to achieve your desired results.Sincerely, Dr. Katzen.

13692663,question,,"When considering multiple cosmetic procedures, the process involves careful planning to ensure safety and optimal results. It's common to combine surgeries, but there are typically limits on the duration of each operation to ensure patient safety. The general guideline is that elective surgeries should not exceed six hours, though this can vary depending on your surgeon's approach and experience and your individual risk profile. Twelve hours is too long for an elective outpatient aesthetic surgical procedure (and these procedures should easily take less than 6 hours). For the procedures youre considering, its likely that some can be done together in one session, while others might require staging. Ultimately, the most effective plan will depend on your specific goals, health status, and recovery time. Its crucial to consult with an experienced plastic surgeon who can assess your case, determine the safest way to combine the procedures, and create a personalized plan based on your priorities and desired results.Krishna Vyas, MD, PhD, MHSHarvard, Hopkins, & Mayo Clinic Trained Aesthetic Plastic SurgeonNew York, New York","Krishna Vyas, MD, PhD, MHS answers: Is 12 hours too long for surgery?",/question/12-hours-long-surgery

	&nbsp;While general anesthesia is overall safe for patients who are healthy, like any medical intervention, it is not without some risk. One of the guiding principles of Mohs surgery is to perform a procedure that is minimally invasive. This translates to all aspects of the procedure including the use of anesthesia. Mohs surgeons use local anesthesia the vast majority of their repairs. Sedation might be considered in a few situations. if the patient cannot sit or lay still for the entire duration of the procedure, or if the patient is extremely anxious and does not feel that they can tolerate the procedure, it is often easier to give the patient a sedative or put them to sleep. Age is not a contraindication to general anesthesia. Many individuals age 75 and up receive it as long as their are no underlying health concerns. However in my practice, I have found that I can perform the majority of my repairs, from skin grafts to forehead flaps for nose repairs, under local anesthesia.

	Mohs Surgery, named after the inventor, Frederick Mohs, is where the surgeon also acts as the pathologist and runs a lab where the entire margin is checked for any remaining skin cancer. This is different than a frozen section at most hospitals, where only partial samples are checked, and thus remaining skin cancer can be missed when the cancer has an irregular shape or growth pattern.

	In our office each layer or stage normally takes 30-45 minutes to excise and check in the lab. The average patient requires two stages, so the entire procedure, including sewing up at the end, takes about an hour and a half to two hours.

	The stages and wait times in our office are this short because the procedure is such a high priority for us. Everything has been prepared in advance of the patient&#39;s arrival. As soon as the tissue is removed it is transported down the hall where it is immediately&nbsp;mapped, sliced onto slides, stained, and then looked at under the microscope.

	While the patient is waiting, a temporary bandage is worn, and the person can lie or sit up in a chair. A friend or family member is welcome to accompany the patient and thus helps to pass the time while waiting for the &quot;all clear&quot; report.

	When you see the doctor that will perform your Mohs Surgery, you will be told or you can ask how long the doctor thinks the procedure might take.

	Don&#39;t worry, even if it takes several stages, more numbing medicine can be used so that the anesthetic never &quot;wears off.&quot;

934963,question,,"
	Post-operative care is a funny thing, as each surgeon has his/her preference as to post-operative care. So it is always recommended to ask your doctor how he/she wishes you to care for your wound.

	Here is some basic information:

	
		Scab is bad. You do not want a scab to form as it slows healing
	
		Cleanse the wound. Some surgeons want you to clean with soap and water, others recommend sterile saline, others hydrogen peroxide (either full strength or half/half with water). Most recommend cleaning wounds once or twice daily.
	
		Keep the wound moist. Moist wounds heal faster and often better than dry wounds. Therefore a petrolatum-(Vaseline)-based ointment works best. Such include Bacitracin, Polysporin, Neosporin, or Bactroban (available by Prescription), which are all antibiotic ointments. Some physicians recommend Vaseline or Aquaphor Healing Ointment.
	
		To cover or not to cover, that is the question. If you keep the wound moist with a petrolatum-based ointment, it may not be necessary to cover the wound--as long as the ointment stays on the wound. On areas that are prone to coming in contact with clothing or bedding, it is often preferable to cover the wounds to avoid making a mess.

931648,question,,"
	The issue with scabs is that scabs cause scars. We were all told as children not to pick scabs because it meant something was healing. But what it actually meant was that something was scarring. So, you can shower and try to lightly remove the scabs after your scalp has been wet for a for minutes. Don't scrub, but just lightly rub, even with a q-tip or two. If that's not getting the scabs off you can take some gauze or a thick papertowel, wet it and place it over the area. Let it sit for awhile. The wetness will loosen the scabs. After the scabs are off, goop it up with Vaseline or Polysporin and keep it gooped up for the entire week. This will help it not scab over, and will allow new pink fresh skin to begin filling in the area. If you have any questions or issues, call the surgeon's office. I often see my patients a day or so out for post-wound checks just to make sure they are cleaning everything properly and it looks good. Any doctor should be willing to see you if you have a post-wound concern.

13565862,question,,"Thank you for your question about the changes you noticed six months after your full body lift. It sounds like you're experiencing unexpected changes, especially in your upper stomach, mons pubis, back, and inner thighs. I understand how frustrating this can be, especially when the results initially aligned more with your expectations.The upper stomach sticking out more than the lower stomach could be due to a few factors. One possibility is that swelling or fluid retention can still persist up to six months post-op, especially in areas that were surgically altered. Additionally, muscle laxity in the upper abdominal region that wasnt addressed during the surgery might be contributing to the protrusion. If the lower abdomen was tightened but the upper wasnt, this can sometimes create an imbalance in contour.As for your mons pubis sticking out, this area is often addressed during a body lift, but depending on the technique and amount of tissue removed, there can sometimes be residual swelling or fat that affects the overall contour. If the mons was not adequately lifted or fat wasnt sufficiently removed, this could explain why it sticks out more now.Your concerns about back fat and the section between the breasts and back could be due to weight fluctuations or a natural redistribution of fat after surgery. This area, like the mons, can also retain some swelling for several months. Additionally, if these areas werent specifically addressed during the body lift, they may have become more noticeable as other parts of your body healed and tightened.Regarding your inner thighs, it's important to note that a full body lift typically focuses on the midsection, lower back, and sometimes the buttocks and thighs. However, inner thigh correction usually requires a specific thigh lift procedure, which may not have been part of your body lift unless explicitly planned.I recommend having a follow-up consultation with your surgeon to address your concerns and clarify what was included in your body lift. If the areas youre unhappy with werent addressed, a revision or additional procedures like a thigh lift or mons pubis lift may be necessary to achieve the results you want.Sincerely,Dr. Katzen","J.

1737527,question,,"First, it's impossible to say whether a skin graft would have been superior to a paramedian forehead flap without seeing photos of the initial defect. This is a very powerful flap for certain nasal defects (large, deep or full thickness). The recovery, however, can be exhausting and take up to one year. Nasal reconstruction results can most often be refined. The forehead flap can be thinned and scars blended with laser. You do appear to also have some bulk on the left side of your nasal bridge in an area where I don't usually see it. To my eye, that is the most distracting aspect of the repair. I would try to be patient and followup with your surgeon. Refinement can typically begin around three months following surgery.

	There is no one right answer to your question as there are many different scars related to the type of skin and its texture of the patient undergoing surgery. Some people are prone to darkening of their pigment after surgery and others develop red blood vessels around the scar. Some can get overhealing where collagen of their body continues to be produced and deposited in the scar excessively which produces a raised, sometimes painful, scar which may be a hypertrophic scar or keloid. Some people&#39;s scars spread, possibly related to an inborn error of collagen&nbsp; and some become inverted as a groove.&nbsp; The scar may have a different shape depending on the shape, depth and diameter of the wound and its relationship to the location of cosmetic structures such as the lip and jaw. The scar may be a line, curve, zig-zag, L-shaped, T-shaped, S-shaped, Z-shaped, H-shaped and other unusual patterns are needed as well. The scar will usually be red for many months. Ultimately, after about 18 months, the body produces maximum maturity of the scar and in the best scenario, it becomes smoother, flatter, and a thin white line. Unsightly scars can be treated, often by Fraxel laser for resurfacing, massage, dressings, V-beam laser for long-standing redness so contact your doctor if you are unhappy.

	Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) tends to grow slowly and invade locally and usually do not kill people the way squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma can (these can spread thru the blood stream called metastasis which BCC does not). &nbsp;But it&#39;s difficult to generalize about how fast they grow--they can grow slowly or quickly. &nbsp;There are some aggressive BCC&#39;s which can invade deeply and into the nerves which can create functional problems (especially if it involves the eye, nose, mouth, or ears). &nbsp;What you see on the surface may just be the tip of the iceberg which is why it&#39;s important to map out the extent of the tumor with Mohs micrographic surgery. &nbsp;If you&#39;ve already had the lesion for 5 years, then waiting a little longer probably won&#39;t make much difference. &nbsp;For new suspicious lesions, it&#39;s best to get it looked at by a dermatologist or Mohs surgeon. &nbsp;It&#39;s typical to have to wait a few weeks to months to get the results of the biopsy and then get scheduled for surgery.

Your surgeon will choose a different incision when combining lip lift with rhinoplasty as opposed to the conventional rhinoplasty incision. Lower blepharoplasty can also be done at the same time. You might experience some additional swelling in the undereye area but overall the recovery should be smooth. Lip lift and lower blepharoplasty are minor procedures and can easily be combined. However, all this is subject to what kind of rhinoplasty you are undergoing and how many hours of Anesthesia would be required.

I have noticed that when I tighten the muscle layers above the mons, this pulls the fatty tissue of the mons together and causes them to bulge. The sugery all by itself can also create swelling in this area.  In most of my tummy tucks, mons reduction is a major part of the procedure. This usually involves removing the deep fat layer and liposuctioning the mons at the end of the surgery. The goal is to have a mons that is not prominent at the end of the procedure. If you have a bulging mons 6 weeks after your tummy tuck, you may need additional liposuction to correct the fullness.","Daniel Reichner, MD answers: Pubic area appears bigger after Tummy Tuck",/question/pubic-area-appears-bigger-after-tummy-tuck

934963,question,,"
	Post-operative care is a funny thing, as each surgeon has his/her preference as to post-operative care. So it is always recommended to ask your doctor how he/she wishes you to care for your wound.

	Here is some basic information:

	
		Scab is bad. You do not want a scab to form as it slows healing
	
		Cleanse the wound. Some surgeons want you to clean with soap and water, others recommend sterile saline, others hydrogen peroxide (either full strength or half/half with water). Most recommend cleaning wounds once or twice daily.
	
		Keep the wound moist. Moist wounds heal faster and often better than dry wounds. Therefore a petrolatum-(Vaseline)-based ointment works best. Such include Bacitracin, Polysporin, Neosporin, or Bactroban (available by Prescription), which are all antibiotic ointments. Some physicians recommend Vaseline or Aquaphor Healing Ointment.
	
		To cover or not to cover, that is the question. If you keep the wound moist with a petrolatum-based ointment, it may not be necessary to cover the wound--as long as the ointment stays on the wound. On areas that are prone to coming in contact with clothing or bedding, it is often preferable to cover the wounds to avoid making a mess.

	This is why the lower incision on a tummy tuck should be marked under tension before surgery. This will predict where the hair will migrate to. Often, I cut out a large amount of hair-bearing mons, so that excessive hairline elevation does not occur. Your mons should not be friends with your belly button! The longer this aesthetic distance, the better- 12-13 cm is ideal. If the mons is puffy, then a liposuction of this area to restore a youthful posture, is appropriate.

561951,question,,"
	First off, I am a Dermatologist.&nbsp; I have a general dermatology practice and perform many cosmetic as well as advanced surgical procedures in treating skin cancers.&nbsp; I am military trained and have&nbsp;worked extensively&nbsp;with 3 Mohs surgeons and have set up Mohs programs in military training centers.&nbsp; Another qualifier is that there are&nbsp;good and not so good physicians in every specialty.&nbsp; In your situation, based on&nbsp;your history,&nbsp;you probably have a squamous cell carcinoma of the lip, which I have removed many.&nbsp; You can have a wedge resection of up to 50% of the lower lip with incredible results, with virtually no scarring and a very natural look.

	&nbsp;

	THE GOOD:

	&nbsp;

	Dermatologist- Everybody knows that if you have a mole, or are concerned about a possible skin cancer, you should see a Dermatologist, the experts in moles and cutaneous malignancy. This is what Dermatologists do all day long is evaluate and remove moles. They are also trained in histopathology and many Dermatologists read their own biopsy slides. Mohs surgeons are Dermatologists trained to remove and close advanced skin cancers. Most Mohs surgeons do nothing else, and all day long they are removing malignancies, tracking their invasiveness under the microscope (completely removing the tumor) and then closing the resulting defect no matter how large or extensive. Most Dermatologists are very adept at evaluating and removing nevi of all types with a very cosmetic result.

	&nbsp;

	Plastic Surgeons- Plastic surgeons are trained in cosmetic surgical procedures of the skin. They are very adept at such treatments as face lifts, blepheroplasty (eyelids), nose jobs, neck lifts, breast augmentation, scar revisions, etc. They are very well trained and usually provide excellent cosmetic results.

	&nbsp;

	THE BAD:

	&nbsp;

	Dermatologist- I'm being honest. There are some Dermatologists, mostly elder ones that were trained many years ago, that are not surgically trained. Certainly they are more than qualified to perform a biopsy to determine if a lesion is a cancer, but some are not interested in doing the more advanced work that is required to remove the malignancy adequately with good margins. Most Dermatologist that feel this way will be happy to refer you to a Mohs surgeon, other Dermatologist or Plastic Surgeon that they feel would provide you with an excellent medical and cosmetic result. And this is very important to them because they will be seeing these patients back for many years and will be able to evaluate the results and are only interested in having a happy patient. All Dermatology training programs for the past 40 years have provided extensive surgical and cosmetic Dermatology as part of their training.

	&nbsp;

	Plastic Surgeons- Plastic surgeons are not trained to evaluate moles. They do not know what a Syringocystadenoma papilliferum or a Merkel cell carcinoma look like. For me I would refer patients for additional surgery for a malignancy to a Mohs surgeon (in actuality I have a Mohs surgeon clear the cancer and then I close the defect), this is what they do routinely. Plastic surgeons do not do these procedures routinely unless they have made that a specific part of their practice. I have had some unfortunate patients that were sent to a plastic surgeon for addition margin surgery and the surgeon used it as an opportunity to do something they don't normally get to do, such as rotate a flap (rhombic flap, O-Z, bilobe flap, etc.) with terrible results. Some of these patients developed hypertrophic scars when they are performed on the arm or back. In my experience it is a good rule to keep it simple, and whenever I can perform a side-to-side repair along natural skin tension lines, I do it. The results often times are much better.

	&nbsp;

	THE UGLY:

	&nbsp;

	The ugly can be avoided. Please be sure to check on your physician's credentials and be sure that they are board certified in Plastic Surgery or Dermatology. Don't be afraid to ask them what they plan to do and what&nbsp;are the potential treatment options. Ask for recommendations from&nbsp;other physicians that you&nbsp;know and respect.&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	This is just my opinion and I don't mean to offend anyone.&nbsp; There are many great responses on this thread.&nbsp; I hope this helps!

12098363,question,,"I would wait at least 6-12 months after giving birth. There is a tremendous amount of change that occurs in your body after birth, and you want to ensure things have settled down before undergoing surgery. If you're worried about anesthesia, many patients tolerate a labiaplasty very well under local anesthesia only. A labiaplasty can be combined with other rejuvenation procedures, but it depends what you're looking for. For example, other rejuvenation procedures include clitoral hood reduction, mons or labia majora reduction, mons fat grafting, or tightening. An anal skin tag removal at the same time can be done, but it would involve rotating you on your stomach to access the anal skin tag.

13692603,question,,"I have written a few papers about penis enlargement, augmentation phalloplasty, and evidence-based outcomes. Safety is always the priority.Penis enlargement surgery can offer modest improvements in both length and girth, but there are risks and limitations that should be carefully considered. Always go to an experienced provider. Complications can be devastating.Lengthening Surgery: The most common method involves cutting the suspensory ligament that attaches the penis to the pubic bone, which can result in an increase of about 1 inch in flaccid length. However, this may not significantly affect erect length. Additionally, some men experience a drooping effect where the penis no longer rises in erection, but instead points downward.Girth Enhancement: This can be achieved through fat grafting (using the patients own fat) or the insertion of dermal fillers or collagen-based materials. These techniques can add circumference, though fat grafts may have issues with uneven absorption, and synthetic fillers can lead to complications like infection, ulceration, or extrusion. The use of Alloderm (a type of cadaveric tissue) has been controversial due to risks of tissue reabsorption or complications.Minimally Invasive Alternatives: Non-surgical treatments, like platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections or fillers, are also options for improving penis girth and overall appearance. These methods generally have shorter recovery times and lower complication risks compared to surgery.While surgery can lead to some visible improvements, the results may not meet all expectations, and the risks of complications are significant. For those seeking a modest increase in size, non-surgical options may offer safer alternatives.

	It's an old wives' tale that you let the air get to a wound and let it scab up to help it heal faster. The truth is that if you keep the wound clean, moist and covered (covered to stay moist) it will heal quicker. A healing wound produces various products in the moist wound bed that help to stimulate wound healing and speed the recovery process. If the wound dries out, those products dry up as well and the wound takes longer to ultimately heal. Check with your doctor, but most dermatologists would recommend: 1. clean the wound with mild soap and water (some areas you might use hydrogen peroxide); 2. liberally apply a bland ointment like Vaseline or Aquaphor or an antibiotic ointment (careful, some people are allergic to neomycin), and 3. apply a non-stick (e.g. Telfa) bandage that is held in place with paper tape. See your doctor for any increasing redness, pus, blisters, increasing pain, fevers, chills sweats or if the wound is not healing. Good luck.

Regardless of who performs the closure, it does take some time for the skin to heal, and the swelling to go down.  Immediately after surgical closure of the wound, it is not unusual for significant swelling to occur, distorting tissues, and sometimes causing a temporary pulling and tightness of the skin.Fortunately, these changes dissipate over 1-2 weeks after surgery.

With that said, I always make it a point to see my patients a few days after surgery and I continue seeing them regularly as the healing progresses.  At these visits, I discuss the surgical closure and ask the patient if they have any concerns about the cosmetic or functional outcome of the surgery.

Fat grafting can add the lost volume, shortening the lower eyelids and camouflaging the prominent fat pads. Laser resurfacing can smooth out finer wrinkles and tighten up the skin. Upper eyelids typically need some amount of skin excision but can also be rejuvenated with volume replacement to the brow eliminating the need for skin excision.

	Minor itching is a part of the natural healing process, especially for a wound as large as yours. &nbsp;But you describe &quot;unbearable&quot; itch, and this makes me concern that you may be allergic to something in the wound care. &nbsp;Many patients can develop an allergy to polysporin, even if they have used it without problems before. &nbsp;That is why, in &nbsp;my cliinic, I usually recommend using just vaseline. &nbsp;Several dermatologic studies have shown that infection rate is no different when patients use vaseline or polysporin after surgery. &nbsp;The other concern is perhaps a sensitivity to the bandage or tape. &nbsp;You may want to consider changing to paper tape as some patients can be sensitive to certain types of bandages. &nbsp;Lastly, you should definitely see your doctor again and bring up your concerns about itching. &nbsp;If you have a severe allergic reaction, topical steroids for a few days may help.&nbsp;

Swelling at the mons may take longer than the rest of the abdomen to resolve as this is the most dependent (bottom-most) part of the surgical field. Gravity pulls fluid downwards. If it does not resolve with time (3-4 months), then one must consider excess persistent excess fat. Prior to the tummy tuck procedure, one may not have noticed the amount of fat present at the mons pubis, as the amount of fat and skin just above the mons may have obscured this or it blended in well with the excess fat and skin present above the mons.As the excess skin and fat is removed, the thinner upper abdominal skin (from above the umbilicus) is brought down, there may be a step-off deformity at the new abdominal skin-mons junction. This is usually addressed during the tummy tuck surgery by either by removing the excess fat present at the mons pubis by either direct excision or liposuction.If the problem persists beyond 3-4 months, you may want to consider reduction of the the mons pubis by liposuction.

Techniques that utilise sutures to alter the eye opening can improve the ptotic eyelid and can also change the eyelid crease but there is a limitation on how much it can do. If there is much asymmetry then an open incision would usually be better. Similarly for procedures done on the underside of the eyelid, the crease cannot be altered so these are only to correct symmetrical problems or in situation when the asymmetry is small.The eyelid scar for ptosis surgery is placed in an ideal eyelid crease and it usually heals well and it is not usually noticeable except when u close your eyes.

	Choosing a treatment for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) involves balancing the cure rate, and expected cosmetic result.&nbsp; For example creams (such as Aldara)&nbsp;can cure some superficial BCC with a cure rate of 75-80% in some cases.&nbsp; Because recurrent BCC can be much more difficult to treat, many people usually&nbsp;favor the approach with the highest cure rate which for your tumor would be Mohs surgery.&nbsp; Your consulting Mohs/dermatologist can give you some idea of what the surgery is likely to involve and what the reconstruction might entail to help you decide.

	There are no lasers approved by the FDA&nbsp;for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma.&nbsp; Photodynamic therapy in which a medicine is applied followed by exposure to a special light (usually not a laser) is available and can cure some superficial BCC.&nbsp; It is not approved for this use by the FDA and has the same issue as Aldara with respect to lower cure rates.

	The idea is to keep the area moist. I recommend Vaseline or preferably Polysporin (not Neosporin) after any removal or surgery. You need to keep the area clean with 1/2 peroxide and water, and keep any scabs or crusty areas off the site. The reason is that even though we were taught as youngsters that scabs are healing, actually scabs equate to scars.

13705896,question,,"Breast reduction surgery can offer significant relief for women who experience physical discomfort, such as back, neck, or shoulder pain, from excessively large breasts. This procedure can also boost self-esteem and improve overall quality of life. For women who are overweight, it's important to note that breast size is often influenced by body weight, as breasts are composed of both glandular tissue and fat. While the glandular tissue removed during breast reduction typically does not regenerate, any weight gain after surgery can cause the remaining breast tissue to increase in size again, potentially leading to enlargement.Many surgeons recommend achieving a stable weight before undergoing breast reduction to help ensure more predictable and long-lasting results. If weight loss is planned, it may be beneficial to wait until youve reached your desired weight to undergo the procedure. This is because the breast size and shape can change with fluctuations in weight. If you are unable to lose weight beforehand, breast reduction can still be a viable option, but maintaining a stable weight post-surgery is important for optimal results. Consulting with an experienced plastic surgeon will help you understand the best timing for the surgery and manage expectations based on your unique situation.Dr. Krishna Vyas, MD, PhD, MHSHarvard, Johns Hopkins, & Mayo Clinic EducatedDouble Fellowship TrainedAesthetic Plastic SurgeonNew York, New York","Krishna Vyas, MD, PhD, MHS answers: Overweight and Breast Reduction Surgery: Worth Doing?",/question/overweight-and-breast-reduction-surgery-worth-doing

12905959,question,,"Undergoing a mommy makeover, which typically involves multiple plastic surgery procedures to address changes that occur after pregnancy and breastfeeding, is a significant decision. Given your history of gastric sleeve surgery and concerns about cardiac arrest, it's essential to approach this situation with careful consideration and the guidance of medical professionals. Here are some key points to consider:1.) Medical Evaluation: Before undergoing any elective surgery, especially if you have a history of previous surgeries or medical conditions, it's crucial to undergo a thorough medical evaluation. Your surgeon and medical team will assess your overall health, including your cardiovascular health, to determine if you are a suitable candidate for the procedures you're considering.2.) Communication: Openly communicate with your plastic surgeon about your medical history, including the gastric sleeve surgery you had six months ago. Share any concerns you have about cardiac health and any recommendations or restrictions your medical team provided after the gastric sleeve surgery.3.) Cardiovascular Risk Assessment: Your surgeon and anesthesiologist will likely assess your cardiovascular risk based on factors such as your medical history, current health status, and any medications you're taking. They will tailor their approach to ensure your safety during surgery.4.) Anesthesia: Different types of anesthesia can carry varying levels of risk. Your medical team will determine the most appropriate type of anesthesia for your situation, taking into account your history and overall health.5.) Recovery and Healing: Both the gastric sleeve surgery and the planned mommy makeover involve surgical procedures. Your body's ability to heal and recover is crucial. Follow your medical team's guidelines for post-operative care, including any restrictions or recommendations related to physical activity and lifestyle.6.) Risks and Benefits: Understand the risks and benefits associated with both the mommy makeover procedures and your cardiac health. Your surgeon should provide you with detailed information about potential complications and outcomes.7.) Second Opinion: If you have concerns about the cardiac risks associated with the mommy makeover, you might consider seeking a second opinion from another qualified plastic surgeon or a medical specialist, especially one with expertise in both plastic surgery and cardiac health.8.) Health Optimization: In the time leading up to your mommy makeover, focus on optimizing your health. This includes following any dietary guidelines related to the gastric sleeve surgery, staying physically active (within your medical team's recommendations), and managing any other health conditions you may have.It's important to remember that your safety is the top priority. Every individual's medical history is unique, and the risks and considerations can vary widely. Work closely with your medical team to ensure that you're making informed decisions that prioritize your health and well-being.","Bryan Curtis, MD answers: Preparing for a mommy makeover, concerned about cardiac arrest?

	Fraxel re:store or re:pair can be initiated at suture removal or one to two weeks after suture removal. In a pilot study in 2005, following Moh's micrographic skin cancer surgery, we resurfaced half a scar at suture removal and the other half was left as internal control. We demonstrated that at 3 months the treated side was at least 50% improved. We postulated that the Fraxel resurfacing laser initiates a cascade of wound healing that appears to be more efficient compared to wound healing without.

	You have two indications to treat your Basal cell carcinoma with Mohs micrographic surgery. One is the location.&nbsp; The nose is an area in which basal cell carcinoma is more apt to recur after standard therapies, such as scraping and burning (curettage and electrodesiccation), freezing with liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy), laser treatment of photosensitized skin (photodynamic therapy) or burning it with laser (laser ablation), excisional surgery which requires a 4 millimeter margin to get a 96 percent chance of cure may remove too much or too little while Mohs surgery starts with a 1 millimeter margin and continues to trace out the extent of the tumor based on microscopic evidence of its location and has greater than a 99 percent chance of cure with primary (not recurrent) basal cell carcinomas while providing the greatest tissue conservation (not removing unnecessary good skin).&nbsp; You are too&nbsp; young to consider radiation therapy as the treatment might cause a worse squamous cell carcinoma twenty years later. Mohs surgery does not mean no scar. It means tissue conservation with the greatest cure rate and at your young age you deserve what Mohs offers.&nbsp; Reconstruction can create a very aesthetically-pleasing scar most of the time and there are treatments, including laser resurfacing, laser for redness, massage exercise and special dressings that can help the scar improve in appearance over time. If you had laser treatment to avoid a scar, you would get a shiny patch, maybe even indented, permanently from the laser and if the skin cancer is not fully treated it would be growing underneath for possibly several years and when it would clinically recur, it would be much larger than now, leaving you with a possible bad cosmetic result. Basal cell carcinoma does not metastasize, or spread, to other body parts via the lymphatic vessels or blood circulation, but it can invade the local neighborhood by direct extension and create problems internally over a decade of persistent growth despite having multiple non-invasive and non-curable treatments.

	Mohs surgery is your best option. You are very young and this was caused by sun exposure you had when you were younger.&nbsp; You must wear a good sunscreen, ultraviolet A and B protection, and avoid sunburns because today&#39;s sun exposure weakens your skin&#39;s immune system&#39;s ability to fight off the DNA damage (from years ago of sun damage) that is trying to grow a cancer today. You may have less than a one percent chance of having this skin cancer recur on your nose if you elect to have Mohs micrographic surgery, but there is a 33% to 50% chance of having a new primary skin cancer on sun exposed skin in the next five years. See a dermatologist every six months, at least, to have your sun exposed skin examined, and the non sunexposed skin should be checked every year.&nbsp; In between appointments with your doctor, you should examine yourself every month with two mirrors to see your back&nbsp; and the posterior view of your legs and if there are new spots they should be checked prior to your next appointment. Furthermore if you have a new spot that bleeds, or looks irregular have that checked. New skin cancers may look red, white, brown, flat or raised.

	At your young age practice Safe Sun.&nbsp; Be outside early or late, not midday if you can avoid it.&nbsp; Wear a hat, long sleeves, sunscreen (but remember to take your vitamin D3 [at least 1000 IU per day] as you won&#39;t make the vitamin D in your skin from sun exposure any longer).

11964240,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding what to do with your abdomen after a 120 pound weight loss after having bariatric surgery in 2018. I would definitely suggest an extended tummy tuck. A mini tummy tuck or regular tummy tuck will not address your entire abdomen. The incision needs to go from as far back as possible underneath the abdominal panus and across the upper pubic region or mons. During your extended tummy tuck, the mons should be lifted and reduced, and the excess skin and fat from above the mons to at least above the belly button should be removed. The rectus abdominus muscle should be plicated. I would also suggest liposuction of the superior iliac crest or the love handles. This will eliminate any residual fat. In regards to the bra line back fat, you did not submit good pictures of the back. However, the options range from liposuction of the back to a horizontal or even vertical torsoplasty. If you wish to go to the liposuction route, I would definitely suggest the VASER liposuction machine. This is the best machine for back liposuction. If you have excess skin of the back, I would suggest either an incision from the armpit down your sides to eliminate the excess skin. Alternatively, if you have a significant amount of back skin, I would suggest a horizontal torsoplasty where the incision goes across your back, underneath the bra strap line.

I am just wondering if it will be possible to even have this surgery when my kids are young. I'm anxious to start my transformation after my weight loss.

13444011,question,,"Morpheus 8 is a non-invasive skin and soft tissue tightening treatment that is consistently amazing in our patients. We use the Morpheus to exact fractional induced RF into the skin or tissue in order to tighten collagen and stimulate contraction of the tissue. For acne scars, it is quite useful to build collagen in patients who have atrophic scars but is not very productive for ice-pick scars which require TCA Cross. For tissue tightening, Morpheus is ideal for the face and neck and we often combine it with CO2 laser or Ultherapy to further enhance results. Chemical peels and skin resurfacing should be done at least 5 to 7 days after, but can be performed earlier, depending on treatment severity. Avoid exfoliating skin treatments before Morpheus and expect a period of 2-4 weeks for skin contraction to set in.

However, when the mons is stretched upward it sometimes reaches higher than the bikini line.  Therefore, it is very important that the top of the mons also be removed with the abdominoplasty, to keep the look natural.  These are important issues to discuss with your surgeon prior to surgery.  It is also important to look at post-operative photos of your surgeon's patients to see how they make the incision.  Since you have already had surgery, you have to address your result.  After abdominoplasty, the mons areas does swell and it can take several weeks to months to completely resolve.  If after six months or so, you are still not happy with the level of the mons pubis, you can have laser hair removal.  Otherwise, you may need a secondary surgery to remove more skin.

1672760,question,,"You may still be experiencing normal post-op swelling.As your body recovers from your tummy tuck surgery, some post-operative swelling is normal and to be expected. As your mons sits just below the abdomen, swelling often seems to migrate lower through the course of your recovery. Double check with your surgeon if you're concerned about the possibility of seroma, or if swelling seems to worsen. Also, I usually include liposuction of the Mons area during my tummy tuck procedures- that may be necessary to produce a flatter pubic area that matches the flatter lower abdomen. To add to this, sometimes a tummy tuck can pull upwards on the mons area, causing a slight upward relocation. At 6 weeks after surgery, it's too early to say which of these (or a combination of both) could be the issue. You'll have a better idea of your final results further along in the healing process.","Frank Campanile, MD answers: Pubic Area Appears Bigger After Tummy Tuck",/question/pubic-area-appears-bigger-after-tummy-tuck

	The likelihood of there being persistent skin cancer in the location is low, but you should return to the surgeon for examination of the area. It is possible that the wound healing is normal, but you could have an infection or reaction to a topical antibiotic or reaction to suture material. The likelihood of persistence or recurrence of basal cell carcinoma after surgical removal without Mohs is about 10% (if the lesion had not been treated before) so it is not likely to be a recurrence or persistence of the skin cancer. What you need to do is see the doctor who performed the surgery so that he/she can examine the surgery site. Good luck.&nbsp;

	To give you a resonable answer, I would need to know how long ago your cancer surgery was done and what reconstructive technique was used&nbsp;following your Mohs surgery. If this is recent, this may all just be scar tissue that would represent a soft tissue deformity&nbsp; that would not be addressed with a rhinoplasty. A rhinoplasty&nbsp; would affect the underlying bony structure.

	You should also consider the possibility of a recurrence of your skin cancer. Make sure you see your original cancer reconstructive surgeon for an opinion.

	There are many reasons why there may be asymmetry after a bilobed transposition flap, some of these resolve with time, some with treatment and some may not resolve completely. The best starting option is to return to the doctor who performed the reconstruction and discuss what has happened and what can be done.

	Bilobed flaps can developing what&#39;s referred to as &quot;trapdooring.&quot; This is a bulging of the flap, caused by the development of scar tissue beneath the flap contracting centrally and producing a pincushioned or trapdoor appearance. This contraction could result in lift of the nasal alar rim and nostril asymmetry. Trapdooring frequently responds to massage and a series of&nbsp;intralesional steroids.

	There are many other reasons that there could be asymmetry or lift of the alar rim. Was the flap designed and executed correctly? Was there any complications afterwards like infection or bleeding?

	The best opiton is to see the doctor who performed the surgery and discuss your concerns. If after a period of time and treatments you are not satisfied, it doesn&#39;t hurt to seek a second opinion. If you see another doctor, make sure that they have significant&nbsp; training and experience in nasal reconstruction. Members of the American College of Mohs Surgery frequently have a great deal of experience in nasal reconstruction following Mohs surgery. Another option is a plastic surgeon or facial plastic surgeon but make sure whichever doctor you might choose that they perform a great deal of nasal reconstruction.

It depends on the number of levels that will need to be taken (usually we can try to give a range for this based on the biopsy results) but no one knows the number of levels until the procedure is being done because we are trying to minimize the tissue removed.

13255470,question,,"Hi,Thank you for your question about minimizing the scar around your belly button, or umbilicus, and your horizontal tummy tuck scar. Based on the pictures you've shared, there are several effective methods to reduce scarring.Firstly, I recommend the nightly application of hydroquinone cream. This should be used consistently for at least six months to achieve the best results. Hydroquinone is known for its skin-lightening properties and can significantly improve the appearance of scars.Additionally, consider undergoing Fraxel laser treatments. I suggest a minimum of three sessions, spaced six weeks apart. Fraxel laser therapy can help in remodeling the scar tissue, making it less noticeable.If, after trying hydroquinone and Fraxel laser treatments, you find that the scar still doesn't meet your satisfaction, surgical revision is an option. This can be performed under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis in the office.These techniques should help in optimizing the appearance of your belly button and tummy tuck scars. I hope this information is helpful, and I wish you good luck with your scar treatment journey.Sincerely,Dr. Katzen","J.

12792397,question,,"Hello @Mgo337, thank you for your question. When addressing a single treatment plan that includes liposuction and tummy tuck, it is best to discuss both options with your surgeon. Liposuction of the mons pubis, hips, and stomach (the latter possibly including a BBL) can be done together with a tummy tuck, for me is the best approach. However, there are some important considerations to make.  it is important to note that having liposuction alone without an abdominoplasty won't get rid of excess skin - this needs to be kept in mind when considering only liposuction as part of the initial treatment plan and the prognosis of that surgery, how it will evolve. In consultation, your surgeon can tell you if liposuction can reduce excess fat in areas such as the mons pubis because liposuction does not solve sagging or loose skin. The operative approach needs careful consideration respecting your particular case. Bear in mind that while you may benefit from getting procedures done at separate times some surgeons might still recommend combining them into 1 surgical session due to potential aesthetic advantages.

13580027,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding changes youve experienced after your tummy tuck. Its understandable to be concerned, especially with how your body feels post-surgery. Based on your description, it sounds like you may be dealing with whats known as a buried penis or penile retraction, which can happen after significant weight loss or abdominal surgery like a tummy tuck.Before your surgery, excess abdominal skin (the flab) likely covered your penis, making it seem hidden within the fold. After the tummy tuck, the excess skin has been removed, and your body is adjusting to its new shape. However, if there is still residual fat in the pubic region or the mons pubis area was not sufficiently lifted, it can cause the penis to sit lower or appear buried behind the testicles.This condition is typically not permanent, and there are treatment options. If the issue is related to excess skin or fat in the pubic area, a mons pubis lift or liposuction of the area can help reveal more of the penis. Its important to follow up with your plastic surgeon to assess the situation and determine the best course of action for you.I hope this helps clarify your concerns, and I recommend discussing these symptoms with your surgeon to explore potential solutions.Sincerely,Dr. Katzen","J.

	Dear AI2266

	
		Sorry to hear you are unhappy with your ears after otoplasty
	
		A revision of your ears will need to be adapted to account for:
		
			
				How far out you would like the ears (projection)
			
				the shape of the ear as seen from the side
			
				the potential for irregular scarring
		
	
	
		Since none of your photos show the ear from the side, its hard to judge what would be most helpful.
	
		Lastly, taking septal cartilage from the nose is a tried and true technique for harvesting grafting material, which should not alter your nose appearance (when performed correctly)
	
		Best Wishes (it is a tough decision that you want to discuss in detail with your surgeon)

7925834,question,,"Aswollen and bruised mons (pubic area) after tummy tuck is very common. This is because gravity brings all of the fluid downward toward this region. At only 6 weeks postop following tummy tuck, you are still relatively early in your recovery. You likely still have a substantial amount of swelling remaining, especially if liposuction of the mons was performed at the time of the tummy tuck. I would recommend following up with your plastic surgeon for a thorough examination to rule out other causes of swelling such as seroma or hematoma. Good communication between patient and surgeon with regular follow-up after surgery is very important. In the absence of other causes for pubic enlargement, it would be extremelyunlikely thatyour pubic region was made larger by thissurgery and normalswellingwill resolve eventually.

While these are technically off label uses of the devices, they are non-invasive modalities used to treat excess subcutaneous fat in a relatively pain free manner with minimal to no downtime.The one draw back to either technology is the delayed effect and the likely need for multiple treatment. These treatments do not directly remove or destroy fat but rather initiate the process of lipolysis (destruction of fat cells). Ultimately, it is the patient's own internal systems which will over time remove these fat cells resulting in a slow progressive loss over the weeks following the procedure.

Many individuals who have previously undergone breast reduction surgeries are able to pursue chest masculinizing top surgery with good results.

If your original reduction involved free nipple grafts, these can be resized and relocated as needed during top surgery (if desired). The nipple and areola can be reattached and repositioned to achieve a more masculine chest appearance. Testosterone is not a prerequisite for top surgery.

	Generally, it is best to follow your surgeon&#39;s instructions for post care, as he or she will know what they did and what they are intending to happen. For most of my patients including Mohs patients, I have them keep the area covered as I left it, for about 2 days. After that I have them remove the bandage and clean the site with 1/2 peroxide and 1/2 water and apply Polysporin. To help wounds heal you want to keep them clean (free from scabs and dried blood) and moist (with Polysporin or Vaseline). Then I have them put a clean bandage back on. Mostly because I don&#39;t want the sutures to rub and frankly, because other people don&#39;t like to see sutures on people&#39;s faces.

	As you know, Basal Cell Cancer, even though not an aggressive tumor by any means, is still a cancer. &nbsp;Nodular BCC by defnition could be extending vertically and deep in addition to the outside periphery. Mohs surgery could remove the cancer cells entirely while sparing the uninvolved skin. &nbsp;If the cancer is in fact only 2mm, the potential scar and recovery could be very minimal and should not interfere with your daily activities. However, if the cancer is allowed to progress and get bigger, it would need more removal of tissue with result of a potentially larger scar.

6128357,question,,"Dear Ariela,Thank you for your question regarding the pubic area appearing bigger after a tummy tuck. Since you are only six weeks after your tummy tuck, I believe you are still swelling. After a tummy tuck or any surgery, there will be swelling. After a tummy tuck, pubic swelling is normal. Most of the swelling after a tummy tuck is gone after six to eight weeks. However, if you had a big tummy tuck with liposuction, the swelling will last a little longer. Since this area is of concern to you, I would suggest you follow up with your plastic surgeon. For now, I would wear a tight compression garment to minimize any swelling or edema in the pubic region. I would give you at least another three to four months before re-evaluating this area. If the pubic area is still large six months after your tummy tuck you may want to consider pubic or mons area revision. Typically, a pubic reduction after a tummy tuck can be done with liposuction. Often, mons liposuction can be done in the office or outpatient surgery setting. If the pubic region or mons is more extensive, you may need a monsplasty. During the surgery, an incision is made through the tummy tuck scar and the mons is lifted and reduced. Rarely, a vertical monsplasty is performed where a vertical incision is made from the top of the labia towards the tummy tuck scar. I hope this answers your questions about swelling of the pubic area after a tummy tuck. If you have any more questions regarding pubic revision monsplasty, pubic healing or plastic surgery, call my office When seeking treatment for the pubic region, please seek an experienced, board-certified plastic surgeon who has performed thousands of these procedures.

If you have a not-so-high tip projection from the side view, making a more projected tip would make the nose look more narrow, and you can simulate this at home by lifting your tip by putting Q-tips in both your nostrils and lifting them upwards. Also, to correct the bulbous tip (fullness), cartilage trimming and sutures are essential. Second, an alar width narrowing procedure, such as 'weir excision'.The alar width looks wide and correcting this width would make your nose make more narrow.Thank You. As you have mentioned the side view looks good since you have adequate radix height and tip projection. I assume that you have some concerns regarding the frontal view of your nose.

While it might need to be evacuated, which would involve lifting the flap, warm moist compresses as much and as long as possible can resolve this more quickly. As far as the numbness is concerned, this may be caused or partially caused by compression from the mass. Once the mass is resolved, you might get back normal sensation. On the other hand, if the sensory nerve was sacrificed when the tumor was removed, you are unlikely to ever restore normal sensation completely. Be patient andutilize the warm moist compresses. You should also contact the Mohs Surgeon who did the surgery and request to be seen for this. Other factors may be involved that only he/she would be aware of.","John Louis Ratz, MD answers: 2 weeks since Mohs repair using flap. Numbness and hard mass normal?

Warping of the rib cartilage can happen and if its mild&nbsp;it may be camouflaged with fillers,&nbsp; otherwise a revision rhinoplasty may be required to address the problem.

The advantages of using diced cartilage is that it is an efficient use of cartilage hence minimising multiple donor sites. In your case, as you already have a rib cartilage, we can diced that up and wrap it with the DTF. The DC+DTF construct will also not warp.

A monsplasty is a plastic surgery procedure to improve the appearance of the mons region. This can include the removal of fat or elevation of the mons. It has nothing to do with and does not mention any hernia repair. In addition, liposuction will not repair a hernia.Furthermore, possible hernias do not repair themselves even with weight loss or liposuction. If you have a hernia, it should be fixed. It should be fixed before the liposuction but can be during the same procedure. A hernia repair, a monsplasty, and liposuction can all be performed simultaneously. However, the hernia needs to be fixed first. A hernia does not need to be fixed if you don't; if you still believe you have a hernia with a negative ultrasound, I would suggest a CT scan for full confirmation.

However, the small doses in an average multivitamin or a few gummy vitamins are usually not enough to pose a significant risk.That said, it is important to let your surgeon know what you took and the amount of vitamin E in those gummies. Your surgeon will be able to assess the situation in the context of your individual case and determine if any adjustments are needed.

The main concerns with being sick before surgery are the potential complications with anesthesia and healing. A respiratory infection can make anesthesia more risky and can lead to post-operative complications, including infections or pneumonia. Coughing after surgery can also be very uncomfortable and interfere with healing.Its always best to discuss your symptoms with your surgeon, who will consult with the anesthesiologist to determine whether it's safe to proceed.

13678995,question,,"The general recommendation for starting scar treatment after a tummy tuck is around 2-4 weeks post-surgery once the incisions are fully closed and healed. At this stage, most patients can begin using silicone-based scar treatments such as silicone sheets or gels, which help improve the appearance of scars by preventing excess scar tissue formation. It's crucial to consult your surgeon before beginning any treatment to ensure your incisions are fully healed.Here is a general timeline for after-surgery care:0-2 Weeks: Focus on wound care (keeping the area clean and dry).2-4 Weeks: After a follow-up with your surgeon, you can start using silicone products (if the incision is fully closed).4-6 Weeks: Topical treatments like scar creams and massage can be added if your surgeon approves.Beyond 6 Weeks: Continue using silicone products, and consider professional treatments if needed. Remember that scars continue to remodel over a year, so it is important to keep it out of the sun or exposed to UV.

Due to the presence of extra skin, a periareolar approach may not be the ideal choice for you. This method is generally best suited for individuals with less skin excess and smaller breast volumes. A double incision approach would be a more appropriate solution. This technique allows for the removal of a larger amount of skin and tissue, as well as better control over resizing and repositioning the areola compared to the periareolar approach.If minimizing scars beneath the chest is a priority, it's important to discuss all potential options with your plastic surgeon.

13672670,question,,"It's understandable to feel anxious about the healing process after top / chest masculinization surgery. The appearance and healing of nipple grafts can vary greatly among individuals due to a variety of factors, including post-operative swelling, surgical technique, skin elasticity, etc. The healing of the nipple grafts can undergo changes that take several months (sometimes up to a year) for the final result to fully appear. It's not uncommon for nipple grafts to be raised or puffy during the initial healing phase. This is often due to swelling and can last for several weeks to months. The healing process for nipple grafts is gradual, and it can take time for them to flatten out.Massaging the area and using ointments like Vaseline is a good way to support the healing process. You may not see immediate changes within just a few days or even weeks. Be patient and continue with your post-surgery care as instructed by your surgeon.

In yourcase, I would highly suggest an extended tummy tuck or even a 360 circumferential lower body lift with mons reduction. During the extended tummy tuck, excess abdominal skin is removed from the top of the pubic region to well above the belly button. A large football shaped area of skin and fat is removed. Also, during a tummy tuck, the rectus abdominis muscle or abdominal wall muscles are sutured with permanent sutures. The result is a nice flat. By extending the incisiontowards your hips or even around your hips or even meeting in the buttock region will allow you even more body contouring. By analyzing your pictures, you will not achieve the same results with a panniculectomy and 360 liposuction. With a panniculectomy, only a minimal amount of skin is removed. During a tummy tuck, more skin and fat is removed. Also, during a panniculectomy the abdominal muscles are not repaired, Therefore, your abdomen will still protrude after a panniculectomy. Also, based on your pictures and history, I do not think that your skin will snap back with only liposuction. In my opinion, if you have liposuction, even VASER liposuction, you will still be left with lots of loose, hanging skin. This may in fact look worse than it does now. Therefore, I would suggest an extended tummy tuck (or lower body lift) with mons reduction and not a panniculectomy with 360 liposuction.

Women of all shapes and sizes&nbsp;may have&nbsp;a larger mons than they like which can&nbsp;be bothersome to them.&nbsp;This&nbsp;can be improved through Liposculpture.My recommendation for you would be an in-office Liposculpture of the pubic mons&nbsp;and labia majora with tumescent anesthesia followed by labia majora reduction all in the same surgery.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is quite similar to performing abdominal liposuction with mini-tummy tuck. The results are very nice.You should seek out a cosmetic surgeon experienced in both liposculpture and&nbsp;vaginal rejuvenation. &nbsp;&nbsp;","Oscar A.

2371644,question,,"Thank you for your question. You definitely want to follow your own surgeon's post-op activity instructions. This is a general guide I give to my patients as to the recovery after breast surgery:Week 1)  Discomfort and tightness level progressively decreases with each day.  Swelling decreases a great deal after one week.  Most people return to work in some capacity.Week 2)  Unlikely to need any narcotic support except maybe at night.  Swelling and tightness continues to improve compared to week 1Weeks 3-6)  May need tylenol or ibuprofen for intermittent discomfort. Swelling completely resolved.  Tightness may continue as the implants over an additional few months into their final position.   As far as activity, here is a safe guide:1)  No heavy lifting or strenuous activity for 6 weeks (a gallon of milk as a guide).2)  Resume walking at a leisurely pace right after surgery (e.g. 2 mph)3)  At 2 weeks, you can walk 2 miles at 2mph4)  At 3 weeks, you can walk 3 miles at 3mph5)  At 4 weeks, you can walk 4 miles at 4mph6)  At 5 weeks, you can jog 5 miles at 5mph7)  At 6 weeks, you can resume all activities, but listen to your body and use discomfort or tightness as a guide so you don't over do it. So as far as the little ones, I would recommend having help for basic needs like lifting into the car seat.  You can cuddle with them while you are sitting down, but you should avoid the tendency to multitask with one child in your arms while you are busy doing other tasks.In contrast, a rhinoplasty really requires limited contact with the nose for first week or two and can be protected with an external splint.&nbsp; You won't be restricted to lifting as much as a breast lift procedure so caring for your child should be much easier.","Young R.

	The problem you describe is a known complication of otoplasty.&nbsp; It appears you have underone excision with almost immediate recurrence.&nbsp; The question is prompted whether you have other areas of scar on your body that demonstrate keloid healing.&nbsp; Initiallly, an injection of a combination of a calcium channel blocker and steroid may be considered.&nbsp; In addition, in some cases of hypertrophic healing and keloid formation, the topical application of a 10-15% gel of calcium channel blocker may be helpful.&nbsp; Since you have recently had surgery, as a less appealing option you may ultimately require reexcision with immediate post operative radiation.&nbsp; In order to coordinate this, you would likely have to consult with your surgeon and a radiation oncologist.&nbsp;&nbsp; The post operative dose is usually fractionated over three days.

	Yes, a mole on the eyelid can be safely removed. I&#39;m not sure that I would agree with the doctor who said that you would risk ingrown hairs. It&#39;s possible that the lesion can be shave removed (also know as tangential excision). In this procedure the lesion is shaved flat with the surrounding skin and no sutures are required. Of course, any surgical procedure does have risks such as infection, scarring, recurrence, but the doctor who performs the treatment can discuss this&nbsp;with you further. My opinion would be to see a specialist who performs a lot of surgery on the eyelids, either a dermatologist who has completed a fellowship in Mohs surgery (fellow of the ACMS) or an ophthalmologist who has performed a plastic surgery fellowship (oculoplastic surgeon). Good luck.

13680050,question,,"I specialize in gender-affirming top surgery and targeted nipple reinnervation and sensory preservation/restoration.It is common to experience numbness or altered sensation in the surrounding areas after top surgery, especially around the incisions or areas where the tissue was manipulated. The loss of sensation can extend beyond the directly operated area, such as up to the armpit or above the nipple, even if those areas were not directly operated on. This is due to nerve disruption during surgery, as nerves from the chest and back are affected when the breast tissue is removed or repositioned. While loss of sensation is normal, it usually recovers over time. However, if the numbness persists for a prolonged period&mdash;such as two years&mdash;there is a chance it may be permanent. Nerve regeneration tends to occur most significantly within the first 6-24 months post-surgery. After that, the nerves may not fully regenerate, and the sensation in those areas could remain altered or absent. Despite numbness, it's still possible to experience pain in the affected areas, as some nerves might convey pain sensations even if touch or pressure sensations are lost.

If a scab is still present this long after surgery, it is likely that the wound needs further healing and treatment with an emollient-like barrier treatment such as Vaseline or Aquaphor.  A scab should be avoided, and the healing wound should be allowed to heal with a moist, clean environment, and healing will occur more quickly.  Think of the cells of a healing wound migrating from the neighboring normal and uncompromised tissue, and needing to slide into place or over the nearby cells to enter the wounded tissue area and ultimately form new skin in the wound.  It is easier to slide into place if the area is moist, vs if it is dry.  Remember to keep the area clean, with soap and water once or twice daily, or as directed by your physician.

13702985,question,,"Based on your photos and breast size, the double incision top surgery seems to be the most suitable option for you. This technique is ideal for individuals with medium to large breasts or excess skin, as it allows for more effective tissue removal and provides better chest contouring. The procedure also gives you the flexibility to position the nipples above the pectoral muscles, achieving a more masculine chest appearance. While the double incision does leave scars across the chest, they improve over time, and the overall results are often more satisfying for individuals with larger breasts.On the other hand, periareolar (keyhole) surgery is typically recommended for those with smaller breasts and less excess skin. It involves an incision around the areola, which may not always allow for nipple placement above the pec muscles. Given your goals for nipple positioning, this may not be the best choice.

Most patients are off of narcotics within a week after surgery. Having a tummy tuck with muscle tightening can also contribute to postoperative constipation.

If you don't like how it looks now, post surgery, yes, there are options for repair, but your surgery did remove the skin cancer which was the primary goal of the procedure. If a cancer was large and in specific areas, we often have to do the surgery, then let the site heal, then do a secondary type of corrective repair.

2371686,question,,"Thank you for your question. You definitely want to follow your own surgeon's post-op activity instructions. This is a general guide I give to my patients as to the recovery after breast augmentation:Week 1)  Discomfort and tightness level progressively decreases with each day.  Swelling decreases a great deal after one week.  Most people return to work in some capacity.Week 2)  Unlikely to need any narcotic support except maybe at night.  Swelling and tightness continues to improve compared to week 1Weeks 3-6)  May need tylenol or ibuprofen for intermittent discomfort. Swelling completely resolved.  Tightness may continue as the implants over an additional few months into their final position.   As far as activity, here is a safe guide:1)  No heavy lifting or strenuous activity for 6 weeks (a gallon of milk as a guide).2)  Resume walking at a leisurely pace right after surgery (e.g. 2 mph)3)  At 2 weeks, you can walk 2 miles at 2mph4)  At 3 weeks, you can walk 3 miles at 3mph5)  At 4 weeks, you can walk 4 miles at 4mph6)  At 5 weeks, you can jog 5 miles at 5mph7)  At 6 weeks, you can resume all activities, but listen to your body and use discomfort or tightness as a guide so you don't over do it. So as far as the little ones, I would recommend having help for basic needs like lifting into the car seat.  You can cuddle with them while you are sitting down, but you should avoid the tendency to multitask with one child in your arms while you are busy doing other tasks.I would keep your surgeon informed of the breast changes after lifting, especially if the pain persists.&nbsp; Your implant should be intact, and it is most likely just a strain on the tissues causing increased discomfort.&nbsp; ","Young R.

You have developed saggy skin on your abdomen, mons pubic area, front and outer thighs, abd definitely buttocks plus your lovehandles are very thick and after liposuction those will be one very saggy. So as expert on After Weight Loss surgery you will be a great candidate for a Lower body lift which means a Circumferential TT and implies a Mons lift, front thigh lift, buttocks lift and  tightening of lovehandles. You are not getting any younger (as any of us) so your tissues will only become saggier over the years so thus would be a great time to Lift all that is saggy. If you consider LBL is too much,  a great option would be an Extended Tummy Tuck with muscle but no lifting of buttocks, thighs and either lovehandles tightening. Definitely only liposuction is not a good alternative because you have a severe degree of saggy skin and also  lipo before TT or LBL is not a good idea because it will leave a lot of scar tissue which will ruin the possibility of a safe Tummy Tuck in the future.

13678984,question,,"Its completely understandable to feel nervous about anesthesia and waking up during surgery, but the risk is extremely low, especially for breast lift surgery. For most cosmetic surgeries, including breast lifts, general anesthesia is used, which makes it very unlikely that you'll wake up during the procedure. For a breast lift, there is typically no need for paralyzing drugs that completely immobilize you. The anesthesia team monitors you throughout the procedure and adjusts the level of anesthesia if needed. If there is any sign that you might be feeling discomfort, they will administer more anesthesia to ensure you're unconscious and comfortable. Anesthesiologists use advanced monitoring equipment to ensure you remain safely under anesthesia throughout the surgery. Be sure to discuss any concerns with your anesthesiologist before surgery so that you feel comfortable! Remember, the vast majority of people who undergo breast lift surgery do so without any issues with anesthesia. The surgical environment, particularly in accredited surgical centers with experienced anesthesiologists and surgeons, is designed for safety.

13034895,question,,"Hi Amy- this is a very nuanced question, so I'm glad you are being cautious. Plastic surgeons often need to have been in practice for a couple of years in order to earn their board certification, so if this person seems young, it is possible that is what is going on (you should be able to contact him or his office and they would be able to answer that for you, or that he is board eligible). If, however, that is NOT the case, then I would encourage you to exercise EXTREME CAUTION attempting to go to a non-board certified surgeon. Board certification exists for a reason- we have to prove that we have both the clinical knowledge and skillset in order to earn it, and if someone was not able to get that for some reason, it should be a big red flag to you.

	Scars usually fade over time, so patience is important. I would speak with your plastic surgeon about ways to reduce the chance of hypertrophic or keloid scarring.

	Probably the most common issue my patients face when having a Makeover for Mom is how to care for their toddlers post-operatively. &nbsp; Most mommie makeovers include a breast augmentation and a tummy tuck, which, in my patients, include extensive muscle manipulations. &nbsp;When muscles are involved in surgery lifting should always be avoided post-operatively, which of course, means you cannot lift your toddler. &nbsp;This can be a deal breaker for some moms. &nbsp;I recommend a minimum of three weeks, and would prefer six weeks of no lifting. &nbsp;Most moms are so used to be being the primary care taker for their family that it is difficult for them to take the time necessary to recuperate. &nbsp;Remember, your Makeover is your family's gift to you for all you've done for them. &nbsp;Take the time necessary to recover. &nbsp;You will be a better care giver in the long run, and more importantly...you deserve it.&nbsp;

	Nasal reconstruction after Mohs surgery is tricky; the goal is for excellent functional and cosmetic results for years to come - not just for the first few days or weeks.

	Sometimes, in order to get good long term results, reconstruction is more involved (ie, flaps and or cartilage grafts) than one might imagine (ie, simple sutures or skin grafts). The healing from these more involved repairs may take several months, but the long term results are worth it.

	Give it time - follow up with your reconstructive surgeon as he recommends. If you are still dissatisfied at 1 year, revision may be appropriate.

	Good luck!

	Thank you for your question regarding the common scenario that dermatologic surgeons face on an almost&nbsp;daily basis.&nbsp; First,&nbsp;I am glad you chose&nbsp;to have your skin cancer treated with Mohs micrographic surgery.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is well-established as the standard of care and highest cure rate procedure&nbsp;for&nbsp;non-melanoma skin cancers such as yours.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Regarding the choice to let the surgical wound heal in on its own, that is a more complex choice, and I agree that every surgeon has their own techniques and reasons for choosing a particular way of healing a surgical wound.&nbsp; Areas that are concave, such as the area you had treated, are a very reasonable place to consider second-intention healing, meaning letting it heal on its own.&nbsp; Sometimes, this provides a superior repair than another more involved&nbsp;procedure&nbsp;could achieve, although the healing time is typically longer.&nbsp; A skin graft is also a reasonable option in this area, so long as there is sufficent&nbsp;tissue&nbsp;remaining over the cartilage.&nbsp; Ultimately,&nbsp;I&nbsp;often make&nbsp;these types of decisions based on the best alternative after a thorough discussion with the patient to understand his or her expectations.&nbsp; Before seeking a second opinion,&nbsp;I'd first consider discussing further with your surgeon to further understand why he chose that option.&nbsp; If you still would feel more comfortable seeking another opinion, I'd suggest a consultation with a fellowship-trained dermatologic surgeon, certified by the American College of Mohs Surgery (ACMS).&nbsp;

13612670,question,,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) generally grows slowly, but the rate can vary depending on several factors, including the location, individual immune response, and the tumors characteristics. In many cases, SCC can take months to even a couple of years to reach a size of 1 cm, as you've described. The fact that your nodule has been growing for about two years before reaching this size is consistent with a slower-growing SCC, which is more common.However, while SCC tends to grow gradually, it is still important to treat it promptly once diagnosed. Left untreated, SCC can eventually become more aggressive, invading deeper tissues or spreading to nearby lymph nodes or distant organs (though this is less common). The biopsy confirming SCC is crucial, and based on that result, your healthcare provider will recommend the next steps, which often involve surgical removal of the lesion. Early intervention can effectively eliminate the cancer and reduce the risk of further complications.I encourage you to follow up with your dermatologist or healthcare provider to discuss treatment options, which may include excision, Mohs surgery, or other modalities, depending on the specifics of your case.","Timothy Jochen, MD answers: How quickly does squamous cell carcinoma grow?",/question/saint-louis-mo-quickly-squamous-cell-carcinoma-grow

13674920,question,,"Thank you for sharing. Top surgery is a broad term that can have varied meanings, especially when discussing gender-affirming surgery. Some individuals want a smaller breast mound, and some want a chest masculinizing procedure. Below, I will focus on a chest masculinizing procedure.A key goal of chest masculinizing top surgery is to effectively remove excess skin and reshape the chest. Due to the presence of extra skin, a periareolar approach is not the ideal choice for best contour; this method is generally best suited for individuals with less skin excess and smaller breast volumes. Although some may desire minimal scarring and a quicker recovery, techniques like laser liposuction or the keyhole incision are not suitable for patients with significant breast tissue, drooping (ptosis), or enlarged areolas, as these options often result in suboptimal outcomes, such as residual tissue or poor chest contour. In contrast, a double incision provides a more natural, masculine appearance, even with the trade-off of scars, which typically heal well over time. A chest masculinizing breast reduction (top surgery) with double incision approach (and/or free nipple grafts and/or targeted nipple reinnervation for sensation) would be a more appropriate solution. This technique allows for the removal of a larger amount of skin and tissue, as well as better control over resizing and repositioning the areola. Liposuction should be combined with this procedure to achieve skin redraping and remove excess adipose, especially near the axillary area and lateral chest. It is also important to consult with a qualified gender-affirming breast surgeon who can assess your goals and anatomy to determine the best technique for you.Krishna Vyas, MD, PhD, MHSHarvard, Hopkins, & Mayo Clinic Trained Aesthetic Plastic SurgeonNew York, New York","Krishna Vyas, MD, PhD, MHS answers: What's my Best Surgical Option for Gynecomastia/FTM Top Surgery?

	A prominent mos pubis after a tummy tuck usually results fro a combination of factors. Firstly, the pubic skin may be pulled up accentuating the mons. Secondly, the surgeon may have left a little too much fat in the mons giving the appearance of a bulge when you wear clothing ( patients tell me that they feel that they&nbsp; look like a Ken doll).

Sometimes, if your surgery was performed within the last few months, the mons may just be swollen, either diffusely, or with an isolated fluid collection. Time and possible a compression garment may be helpful. If a discrete fluid collection is present, aspiration with a needle may solve the problem. I suggest you speak to your operating surgeon about your issue.

12088526,question,,"Thank your for your question! I agree with your surgeon with regard to the tendency of this area to retain edema for months after surgery. There are two common causes of persistent or recurrent lower abdominal bulging after an abdominoplasty. One is an untreated or recurrent diastasis recti (separation of the rectus abdominis muscles). If this is the cause, re-operation is necessary to perform a rectus plication. The second relates to the fact that, for many patients, there is a significant difference in thickness between the upper abdominal skin and fat (often 1 inch thicker) and the mons/groin skin and fat. These two areas are brought into contact when the upper abdominal skin is pulled down and your incision is closed. I disagree with your surgeon's statement that the upper abdominal fat cannot be safely thinned to match the mons/groin thickness during an abdominoplasty. I routinely perform this maneuver specifically to avoid the lower abdominal bulge/fullness and create a seamless transition during my abdominoplasties. At this point, I agree with waiting 9-12 months prior to a touch-up procedure to eliminate the effects of edema/swelling as much as possible so that when you have liposuction your surgeon can accurately thin the bulging area and create a natural, harmonious transition.","Derek Fletcher, MD answers: Second opinion on small bulge above incision?

Removing multiple, sizeable skin cancers via Mohs surgery can certainly take a toll on ones skin, therefore I recommend patients like you who have multiple lesions on large surface areas be treated with photodynamic therapy. Photodynamic therapy involves applying a photosensitizing acid to the skin, leaving it on for a period time, and then exposing the skin to certain wavelengths of light and/or laser. The combination of the acid and lights and/or laser is able to penetrate deep within the skin, and effectively kill precancerous cells. Following treatment, patients must avoid sun exposure for 48 hours, and repeat treatment in 4-6 weeks several times for the best result.

	Assuming I understand your question clearly, your mom had breast &nbsp;augmentation in the past and is now experiencing hardening of one breast. She may be experiencing a process called capsular contraction (encapsulation). &nbsp; These terms refer to the process of thickening of the scar tissue layer that normally surrounds breast implants. This thickening of the scar &nbsp;may cause the breasts to feel relatively firm and may cause problems such as pain and/or change of implant position or shape.

First, we should analyze your pictures to determine the best procedure for your body.  On you buttocks and hips, you have cutis pleonasmus (excess skin), dermatocholosis (loose skin), cellulite, and stria (stretch marks).  On you abdomen, from the limited picture, you have excess skin and fat and stretch marks around the umbilicus.  To address the abdomen, hips, and buttocks in one surgery, most plastic surgeons would suggest a 360 circumferential lower body lift.  During a  360 circumferential lower body lift, an abdominoplasty (tummy tuck), mons lift, mons reduction, hip lift, hip reduction, buttock lift, and buttock reduction are performed.  During the tummy tuck portion of the  360 circumferential lower body lift, excess abdominal skin and fat are removed, the rectus abdominis muscle are plicated to correct for rectus diastasis, and the belly button is reconstructed.

Basal cell carcinoma can invade deeper tissues and bone How fast any cancer is going to grow can not be accurately predicted. Squamous cell carcinoma kills approximately 3000 people per year . It is unfortunate when patients do not treat conditions which are so relatively easy to treat and avoids these negative risks.

13397169,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding what to do after your tummy tuck, specifically concerning the bulge in the pubic region. I appreciate your sharing your history and the photos you provided. I'm sorry to hear that you're distressed about the protuberant bulge of skin and fat in the mons region. This is not uncommon after inadequate resection of the pubic area during a tummy tuck.From your description and the photos, it appears that your rectus abdominis muscle is intact, and the primary issue is excess skin and fat in the lower central abdomen and pubic region. Opting for liposuction of the mons might leave you with loose hanging pubic skin and suboptimal results. Therefore, I would suggest considering a pubic reduction or a monsplasty.During a monsplasty, an incision is made in the pre-existing tummy tuck scar. Tissue dissection is carried down to the pubic region, and a crescent area of skin and fat in the pubic region is removed. Additionally, there is typically a ball of fat in the pubic region just underneath the skin and anterior to the pelvic bone that needs to be addressed.The monsplasty or pubic reduction procedure typically takes approximately two hours under IV or general anesthesia. A drain will remain in place for approximately 7 to 14 days to help manage swelling and fluid accumulation.A pubic reduction or monsplasty is an excellent surgery for addressing skin and fat in the pubic or mons region, especially for residual skin and fat left over from a tummy tuck. This procedure should help improve the contour of your lower abdomen and make you feel more comfortable in your clothing.I hope Ive answered your question regarding your options for the bulge you're experiencing after your tummy tuck.

	This is a great question.&nbsp; Over my 20 years as a plastic surgeon, treatment of this area has radically&nbsp;changed in practice.&nbsp; The reason is twofold:&nbsp;

	Firstly, the complete eradication of pubic hair (which is disappearing faster from the planet than the Amazonian rain forest) exposes the mons area to view - it used to be invisible&nbsp;- and secondly, learning more about the form and appearance of the area from the development of surgery after massive weight loss, which provides many surgical challenges and learnings given the often massive skin and tissue redundancy we now see in the pubic area.

	20 years ago, TT incisions were made across the top of the pubic hair.&nbsp; These days, that&#39;s half way between the vulva and the belly button and looks far too high.&nbsp; I still see way too many TT incisions that are too high.&nbsp; Getting the incision low is the first key to an aesthetic result.&nbsp; This also enables removal of a large amount of the redundant or extra skin seen after weight loss.&nbsp; Secondly, if the mons is bulky it should be debulked by liposuction at the time of the initial surgery.

	Beyond careful planning of the skin removal and planning the desired volume and shape of the area (which is normally all that is required for an aesthetic outcome and is all I would do at a primary TT) - if there&#39;s been a massive weight loss and a very large excess of mons pubis, then a secondary reshaping procedure of the mons area might be required.&nbsp; This is specifically for those patients with massive skin redundancy, is done 6 months after the TT or body lift and comprises&nbsp;an aesthetic reshaping of the mons area.&nbsp; This utilises skin reduction, volume reduction, and possibly labial reduction to achieve the best appearance we can achieve.

	I hope this is helpful,

	Good luck.

	While the final choice is yours, it is not a good idea to delay treatment of your skin cancer for such a long time. Basal cell carcinomas tend to grow slowly, but the key word is &quot;grow.&quot; Nobody can tell you exactly how quickly it will grow, and nobody can tell you exactly how large the skin cancer is now. The best option, in my opinion, would be to consider Mohs micrographic surgery, which will start with the smallest margin possible and trace out the roots of the skin cancer, providing the highest cure rate while preserving the surrounding healthy tissue. Delay of your surgery for such a long period will result in a larger skin cancer and therefore a larger surgical defect to repair and therefore potentially a more complicated reconstruction or larger scar. Work out the details of your surgery with your doctor&#39;s office and get the skin cancer treated in the near future.

	Asymmetry after reconstruction can be a temporary or permanent situation. When a flap is created it is basically borrowing tissue from one area to move it to another area that lacks adequate tissue (i.e. the surgical defect). It is very important that the person designing and executing this repair be an individual with training and experience in facial reconstruction. If the design and execution are performed correctly then the problem will likely improve over time (although perhaps not completely since again there is limited loose tissue from which to borrow on the nose). It takes 6-12 months to get the final cosmetic result following reconstructive surgery. Follow up with the plastic surgeon who performed the repair, and if you&#39;re not comfortable and satisfied with the care of that doctor, see another doctor, perhaps a fellowship-trained Mohs surgeon, for a second opinion.

2417857,question,,"While it is always cosmetically desirable to place a patients tummy tuck incision low in the bikini line so it is very well hidden in underwear or a bikini bottom, a patients anatomy will dictate whether this is possible or not without leaving the patient with a vertical scar. &nbsp;What does this mean? &nbsp;A high umbilicus and a short distance of the upper abdomen (as dictated by the patient's pre-operative anatomy) will sometimes require that the surgeon make a slightly higher tummy tuck incision in order to prevent the patient from having a potentially visible vertical scar between the patient's new belly button and the horizontal scar. &nbsp; This vertical scar is a vertical closure of the patients old belly button hole that was not able to be excised in its entirety at the time of their surgery. &nbsp;It is important to keep in mind that when performing a tummy tuck there is generally a large amount of skin and fat that is removed from the abdominal wall. &nbsp;In removing this skin and subcutaneous tissue, the upper and lower boarders of the incision are closed by pulling them together, which tightens the upper and can lift the lower (the mons pubis). &nbsp;In some patient's this is preferable, especially if their mons has sagged after pregnancy. &nbsp;However, for others the effect can be much greater. &nbsp;Swelling can also affect the bulging or firmness of the mons area after a tummy tuck and some patients who are very active might find that the appearance can become more visible as the day goes on. &nbsp;&nbsp;I would recommend following up with your operating surgeon to discuss your concerns. &nbsp;If you are only 6 weeks out from surgery, it is too soon to predict what your final result will be and I would advise you to wait it out a little longer until more of the swelling can subside and your body can heal. &nbsp;With that said, some patients will consider liposuction or a surgical reduction of the mons area if this bulging effect has not subsided after they have allowed for enough healing time. &nbsp;I hope this helps!","Stephen T.

	Tiredness after surgery is a combination of several things, anesthesia and healing. The anesthesia effect resolves rather quickly, usually within the first several days to a week. The tiredness most attributable to healing can take longer.

	Breast augmentation patients usually bounce back very quickly. Tummy tuck recovery can take a bit longer. Once the drains are removed, usually five to seven days you start to feel much better. At two weeks most patients are back to light activity. At three weeks, your will probably be a little tired around 3:00. Generally it takes most people four weeks to get their full energy back.

1830453,question,,"It is very difficult to determine the exact size and shape implant you will require to best match your ideal breast image without an examination by a board certified plastic surgeon. Not just any board certified plastic surgeon, but one with many years of frequently performing breast augmentation surgery including different approaches, techniques and implant choices. This is because several measurements not to mention your breast characteristics are needed to determine the optimal implant size to obtain your goals. Without knowing these dimensions it would be difficult to make this determination. For example, the existing base width of your breast will determine, in many cases, the maximal volume per implant profile that you can accommodate. To illustrate; a 100 cc difference may make a significant difference with a narrow base width breast, but much less of a difference if you have a wide chest wall and wide breast foot print. Therefore, just because your friend may have a great result with lets say a 350 cc implant to make her go from a A cup to a C cup size does not mean that you will have the same result with the same size implant. . Further simply placing implants in a bra to determine the size best for you is not always accurate as the bra often distorts the size, is dependent on the pressure the bra places plus the implant is outside your breast and not under it among other variables. Computer software morphing programs that automatically determine the best implant size can be helpful in some but not all cases (e.g. doesnt work well in my experience with existing implants, sagging or asymmetric breasts).

This communication will be critical in determining&nbsp; breast implant size/type/profile will most likely help achieve your goals.&nbsp;In my practice, the use of photographs of goal pictures (and breasts that are too big or too small) is very helpful.

	&nbsp;&nbsp; All these letters after our names can be very confusing. This is a very good question because sometimes these letters do not mean much, but in this case, these letters are very important!!&nbsp;The main qualification you should look for is certification by the American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS).

That being said, I believe that membership in ASPS and ASAPS&nbsp;are very important resources for the latest in techniques, education and advancements in our field. You must have ABPS certification to belong to ASPS and ASAPS. Furthermore, ASAPS requires that you have proficiency in aesthetic/cosmetic procedures specifically. Some surgeons, myself included, not only&nbsp;belong to all three of these&nbsp;societies, but are also completing the ABPS Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program&nbsp;and I believe that we are maintaining the highest level of training and proficiency. The ABPS-MOC is a ten year cycle of training/education that cumulates in the surgeon having to prove his proficiency with a re-certification test. I would ask your surgeon if they are participating in this MOC program, and ask why if they are not. Once you've navigated the alphabet soup and all&nbsp;things being equal, I would go with the surgeon that you trust, has good results and references and the one you get along with the best. Good luck.

	Both Tummy Tuck and Breast Augmentation can be performed together. When doing these operations together, it limits your recovery and anesthesia exposure to one time.

	One of my patients had these procedures performed at separate times, and felt that the recovery from the tummy tuck was easier than her breast augmentation. She is however, a size 0 and had little skin to remove.

	If you need to do the procedures at separate times, the outcome of one, should not affect the other. Do the one that bothers you the most.

	Pubic area swelling after a tummy tuck is not an uncommon problem.&nbsp; In the early postoperative period (i.e. within&nbsp;4 weeks of surgery)&nbsp;pubic swelling is usually the result of traumatized lymphatic channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, initial treatment consists of compression (i.e. postoperative garment and direct pressue with foam dressings).&nbsp; Symptoms will usually resolve in a matter of weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

	Pubic swelling lasting longer than 6 months is usually due to excess fatty tissue&nbsp;of the mons pubis which has been moved superiorly&nbsp;during the tummy tuck surgery.&nbsp; This can&nbsp;easily be treated with liposuction of&nbsp;the pubic area.&nbsp; I routinely perform liposuction of the pubic area during a tummy tuck procedure to prevent this problem and deliver a&nbsp;very smooth, flat abdomen and&nbsp;mons pubis (which most patients desire).&nbsp;

13671373,question,,"It is understandable to be concerned after seeing images of complications from breast reduction surgery, but it is important to remember that these issues are relatively rare and often preventable. During a breast reduction, the blood supply to the breast tissue (particularly around the nipple) is disrupted, leaving the area with reduced perfusion for healing. Problems like dead tissue (necrosis) and problematic wounds can occur due to poor blood circulation, overly aggressive tissue removal, infection, or pre-existing health conditions that affect healing. Smokers, diabetics, and individuals with obesity are at a higher risk of complications. However, these issues can generally be avoided with careful planning, a skilled surgeon, and proper aftercare. A knowledgeable surgeon will take steps to ensure blood flow is preserved and will carefully plan the surgical technique to minimize risks.While complications can happen, even with the best surgery and aftercare, they are fairly uncommon. Following post-operative care instructions, managing pre-existing conditions, and attending follow-up appointments can significantly reduce the risk. If complications do arise, they are usually treatable if detected early. One of the most common wound healing problems is at the T-junction where the horizontal and vertical limbs of the incisions come together near the bottom of the breast (a typical incision pattern for breast reductions), which can result in minor oozing or a small wound at that point.Ultimately, choosing an experienced surgeon, avoiding nicotine or smoking, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and adhering to all care guidelines are the best ways to minimize risks and achieve a successful outcome. With the right preparation and care, the likelihood of major complications is minimal. Breast reduction is generally a safe procedure with a high patient satisfaction rate, but it is important to discuss benefits, risks, and potential complications with your surgeon.

3003730,question,,"I have read the previous answers and it is obvious to me doctors feel differently about this issue of muscle repair. The answers are confusing to me so they must be confusing to those patients interested in the surgery.By definition the panniculectomy is the removal of the pannus hanging over the very low abdominal skin and possibly the mons pubis. In my practice, this operation involves elevating the skin and fat (after leaving the belly button in place on the muscle wall) from the lower abdomen to the breasts. This leaves a very open space giving a great opportunity to tighten the muscle wall that has been stretched out by pregnancy or weight gain. If one does not tighten this abdominal muscle wall then the result of the new appearance of the skin over the abdomen is still bulging and not as improved as one would desire.I believe the panniculectomy should removed the pannus, tighten the muscle wall and elevate the mons pubis and rejuvenate the vaginal appearance as well.I have had consults with women who have seen a plastic surgeon for a panniculectomy and they accept the insurance for the removal of the pannus but charge extra in cash for the abdominal muscle wall repair.

	It sounds like you are doing a good job with your homework researching breast reduction. You might want to get your mom involved in the research as well. At least this will help you understand what her concerns are and may answer some of them. You should probably wait until your breast size is stable for six months to a year before having any surgery and this happens at different ages for different individuals. I have done a few breast reductions on teens about your age with very good results and very happy patients. You should be aware that there will be permanent scars and you will probably not be able to breast feed your children. You and your mom should talk with your doctor about a referral to a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and then have a consultation with him or her to continue your research.

2842193,question,,Questions about implant profile routinely come up during consultation.   As implant profile increases from mod to mod plus to high to ultra high in round implants of the same size ( volume) the width of the implant decreases.  I recommend and help patients in choosing implant volume ( size) and then base what profile on the measured base width the patients breast.   You want an implant that will fit precisely within the width of your breast to give the best possible result.  For example if a patient chooses a 350cc implant with a base width of her breast of 11.4cm.  We would look at the available implants profiles for 350cc and the profile whose base width is closest without going over to her breast base width is the profile I would use.

12481947,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding whether a tummy tuck or lipo 360 helps target your mom's pouch, back fat, and love handles. Thank you for your history and your photos. Based on the pictures you attached, you have excess skin, excess fat, weak abdominal muscle, and stretch marks. Your stretch marks indicate that liposuction would not be optimal for your tummy. Therefore, in my opinion, whatever liposuction you have, even if you have VASER liposuction, your skin will not retract. In my opinion, you will have hanging skin. I understand if you do not mind the hanging skin to avoid the tummy tuck scar. However, if you have the best results for your tummy, I would strongly suggest a tummy tuck or abdominoplasty. During a tummy tuck or abdominoplasty, an incision is made low on the abdomen, and excess skin from the pubic region to above the belly button is removed. Your muscles are repaired, a new belly button is created, and the pubic region is raised and reduced. In regards to your back and love handles, I would suggest aggressive liposuction with the use of a vaser. These can be combined with your tummy tuck. Thank you for your question regarding whether a tummy tuck or lipo 360 helps target your mom's pouch, back fat, and love handles.

	One of my top recommendations to patients who have undergone Mohs surgery for skin cancer is to make sure they apply sunscreen everyday. Regardless of whether you&#39;re planning on spending the day outside, or simply walking from your front porch to the car, wearing sunscreen is one of the absolute best preventative measures you can do. I often recommend people start putting sunscreen on all exposed areas (usually face, neck and back of the hands) immediately after surgery.

	For the surgical wound itself, I give patients specific instructions that usually include covering the area with a bandage. During this time, sunscreen is not generally necessary, especially if the wound is kept covered. After stitches are removed and the bandage comes off (usually about 1 week after surgery), I recommend starting the use sunscreen over the wound itself.

	Surgical wounds and scars can darken in the sun. Therefore applying sunscreen to this area will help reduce how&nbsp; noticeable your scar will ultimately be.&nbsp;

I'm sorry for what happened with your situation with the drains malfunctioning, necessitating removal, reinsertion, wound breakdown, and then wound packing. It takes scars approximately two years to completely remodel. After two years, the scar will not significantly improve. If the scar and end results are not to your satisfaction, I would consider a revision. During the revision, the scar can be revised. In addition, it looks like your lower abdomen from your umbilicus or belly button to the mons or pubic region is distended. In my opinion, this needs to be tightened. Specifically, the rectus-abdominis muscle in this region needs to be plicated or reinforced. In addition, this may be excess scar tissue. Nonetheless, it requires proper evaluation.

If the nipples are at or above the inframammary line we can generally get by with just a breast augmentation depending on the size of the implant the patient wants.

	Tummy tuck surgery is not weight loss surgery; it is body contouring. The amount of weight loss depends on how much tissue is removed at surgery. The amount of tissue removed is dependent on your maximum weight prior to surgery, amount of weight loss, amount of weight gain with pregnancy, heredity and skin laxity.

	Typically, in mommy make over tummy tucks, there is is only 800 to 2000 grams of tissue removed, which is&nbsp; about 2 to 5 pounds. In body lift patients, it can be more.

	Your focus in this procedure should be improved contour, and not weight loss. If you have an increased amount of intrabdominal fat, this is not corrected by a tummy tuck. In people with increased intrabdominal fat, they should consider weight loss prior to surgery to achieve the optimal result.

9891448,question,,"Thank you for your question on what you do with your abdomen after massive weight loss. Also, whether a Fleur-de-lis panniculectomy (FDL) panniculectomy and mons lift or mons reduction are the right procedures for you after massive weight Loss.Congratulations on your weight loss. What a great accomplishment. In regards to your abdomen, there is no such thing as a fleur-de-lis panniculectomy. Therefore, insurance would only cover a panniculectomy. That means they would only cover a horizontal panniculectomy. A panniculectomy would remove the pannus.The pannus is the part of the lower abdomen (not above the belly button) that hangs over the pubic region.The vertical component of the upper abdomen would not be covered by insurance, as this is cosmetic. In your case, I think a panniculectomy would be sub-optimal surgery. Because of your weight loss, the muscles have been stretched and the fascia has been destroyed. Therefore, in your case, I would suggest an extended tummy tuck or abdominoplasty and mons reduction. An incision is made in the lower abdomen, tissue dissection is carried up to the rib cage and the anterior abdominal muscles are sutured together. If you do not suture the muscles together, your abdomen will still protrude due to the fact you have lost so much weight. If you just undergo a panniculectomy, without the muscle repair, your abdomen will still be distended. I do not think you need a vertical component or fleur-de-lis incision.In my hands, I believe that upper portion of your abdominal wall can be removed by pulling the skin during the extended tummy tuck. In regards to insurance coverage, a panniculectomy can be covered if you meet insurance criteria.Criteria for panniculectomy coverage includes things like chronic skin rashes refractory to antibacterial/antifungal creams and lotions and your pannus must cover your pubic region.Also, most insurance companies require a stable weight for 6 months if you lost weight through diet and exercise and for 18 months if you lost weight through gastric surgery.Usually, insurance companies do not cover the panniculectomy just for low back pain. In comparison to a panniculectomy, a tummy tuck is a more invasive and expensive procedure and is not covered by insurance companies. Insurance companies consider the tummy tuck to be a cosmetic procedure. Thank you for posting what to do with your abdomen. I specialize in reconstructive plastic surgery after weight loss.If you have any more questions regarding the panniculectomy, tummy tuck, extended tummy tuck, high lateral tension tummy tuck, abdominoplasty, lower body lift, 360 circumferential lower body lift, belt lipectomy, belt abdominoplasty, or belt dermolipectomy, please contact my office.

	Most Moms seek a full abdominoplasty (tummy tuck), which removes excess lower abdominal skin and fat (including some stretch marks!), tightens the muscles of the abdominal wall back together, and decreases the waist line. Sometimes liposuction of the flanks and/or upper abdomen are added to the procedure, if needed.

	For women who have not yet reached their ideal weight but who have a large overhang of skin and fat (a &quot;pannus&quot;) in their lower abdominal region, it is possible as an interim procedure, to do a limited &quot;panniculectomy&quot;. This will only remove the overhang but will not address the abdominal muscles or the upper abdomen.

	Be sure to visit a Board-Certified Plastic Surgeon with a great deal of experience in these types of procedures!

	First off, if the lesion is changing (i.e. bigger, darker, raised, itching, etc), it should be evaluated by a dermatologist. Also if the lesion has any of the features of melanoma it should be evaluated by a dermatologist. ABCD stands for Asymmetry, irregular Border, varied Color, and large Diameter. If it is suspicious for melanoma (and you can&#39;t tell without an in-office evaluation), it should be removed or at least a portion of it should be sampled. Since the pigmented lesion is flat, shave or tangential excision will not work as well as excision to the subcutaneous tissue. The lesion would have to be excised, and the repair would be dependent upon the size of the lesion and possible adjacent loose tissue. Based on the photograph, a flap repair would be more likely as a side-to-side repair would likely distort the free margin of the eyelid. I would recommend that you see either a fellowship-trained Mohs surgeon, plastic surgeon or oculoplastic surgeon. Talk to the doctor about their experience in surgery and repair in this area.

You have both excess superficialfatty tissue and skin. You also appear to becarrying some extra weight from deeper fatty tissue. Before pursing plastic surgery, it is important that you are close to your ideal weight to help achieve the best possible contour fromsurgery. In general, patients should have a body mass index (BMI) of less than 30. BMI is calculated based on your height and weight, and there are many calculators online that can be used to check your BMI.It is important to understand that liposuction is not a weight loss procedure, whichis a common misconception. Liposuctionis a procedure used to improvebody shape rather than takingoff pounds. Thefat removed with liposuctiondoes not weighmuch (typically only 1 - 2 pounds). The fat that is removed with plastic surgeryis close tothe surface of the body near the skin(superficial to the abdominal/pubicmuscles). The fat deep to the abdominal/pubicmusclescannot be removed with plastic surgery. In overweight patients, the only way to remove this deeperfat is through diet and exercise or weightless surgery (lap band, gastric sleeve, orgastric bypass).Following weight loss, you will likely havesome remaining loose skin and superficial fat. In the absence of loose skin, liposuction works great to remove fat and allowing the skin to shrink down. However, when there is loose skin, the only way to address it is by surgical removal.This would be in the form of mons lift or panniculectomyin your case, which would entail a similar incision to atummy tuck. Liposuction can be combined with this procedure at the same time to remove excess superficial fat in addition to skin. In the case of a hidden penis from excesssuprapubic tissue, the plastic surgery procedures described can help expose the penis to improve sexual function and hygiene. I would recommend consulting with a plastic surgeon once you have reached a healthy weight to review the available body contouring options.Ziyad Hammoudeh,MD","Ziyad Hammoudeh, MD answers: Fat above Pubic Area.

	Patients undergoing tummy tuck want a flat abdomen with tightened muscles and a thin scar that is located in a low, well concealed position. In an effort to accomplish these goals, surgeons try to place their incision as low as possible. This can result in the wound being closed under significant tension. In other words, both the upper and lower flaps are pulled toward each other. This can result in spread of the scar, elevation of the pubis, and even wound separation.
	When these complications occur, secondary surgery may be necessary because these problems dont resolve on their own. This may require scar revision with re-elevation of the abdominoplasty flaps or liposuction to thin a prominent mons pubis.
	Its important to realize that some elevation of the pubis occurs with every tummy tuck. With aging, the mons pubis tends to sag, so some elevation is not necessarily bad. If elevation reaches the point where its clearly visible, abdominoplasty revision should be considered.

	Basal Cell Carcinomas tend to be a slow growing skin cancer with little risk of metastasis to other body sites; however, the skin cancer does slowly and insidiously grow, destroying the normal healthy tissue. The reason that basal cell carcinomas are treated is because of this slow growth where the healthy tissue is replaced or infiltrated by the skin cancer and because these tumors can spread along nerves, blood vessels, cartilage, etc and be difficult to remove. The fact that you know the tumor has been there for at least 5 years would suggest that it is probably going to be larger than how it appears to you. In other words, the cancer has continued to grow during the five years before you saw the dermatologist. The best option for treating the skin cancer is through Mohs surgery which will give you the highest cure rate and preserve the greatest amount of healthy tissue for reconstrution.

Some patients believe they have a lot of visceral fat when indeed, they dont. In your case, it is wise to undergo a 360 circumferential lower body lift. I think you will obtain exceptional results. The 360 circumferential lower body lift eliminates abdominal, hip, mons, pubic, and buttocks excess skin and fat. It also tightens the abdominal muscle. This will get rid of the excess skin and fat above the rectus muscle. This will tighten your abdominal core. Underneath the rectus abdominous muscle is your visceral fat. This will remain but you can lose further visceral fat by conscientious eating and diligent exercise. Either way, I still would suggest that you undergo a 360 circumferential lower body lift and adhere to a high protein low carbohydrate diet after the surgery.

12785131,question,,"I have been doing these types of procedures for over twenty years. Without photos, it sounds like you probably need a mons pubis lift, possible labia majora fat injections with or without skin excision, and vaginal tightening. You may also need your inner lips reduced. All these procedures can be done at the same time. You can read about them on my website. The mons treatment depend on the your anatomy. I have published extensively on mons pubis reductions and invented some of the techniques. If you have a fat deposit with no excess skin, then you can just have pubic liposuction.  However, liposuction will only reduce 50% of the bulge. If you have skin excess or you want a more dramatic reduction of the bulge, then you need a pubic lift with fat removal and stabilization of the pubic skin to the abdominal muscles.  The incision is usually like a caesarean incision. The potential complications are over lifting the pubic area, concavities, and unnatural scars, so be careful of your choice of surgeon,Many women with a large mons also complain of labia majora enlargement, so this can be doneat the same time.  Many women with sagging or wrinkling of the majora have stretching of skin and normal fat.  In that case, the skin only can be removed. If the skin only is saggy due to fat loss, then only fat can be injected. However, over-injection can cause a large bulge in the genitalia, which can be unsightly. If skin is excessive and fat is diminished, then skin can be excised and  fat injected at the same time. If you only have slight wrinkling, then a laser can tighten the skin. If your labia majora skin and fat are excessive, then skin and fat can be excised to make them smaller and less protruding. The skin excision technique I pioneered leaves a scar on the inside of the majora in the concavity between the majora and the minor and clitoral hood.  I have published and lectured extensively on this procedure in textbooks and throughout the world.  Many physicians are not comfortable or trained in this procedure resulting in poorly placed scars, asymmetry, and poor results. You need to have the surgeon show photos of his past patients.Vaginal tightening can also be performed at the same time.You did not mention your inner labia, but that can also be addressed at the same time with a labiaplasty.A labiaplasty must be performed by a surgeon with experience. One of the two most common techniques is the central wedge technique, which I invented in 1995 and published in the plastic surgery textbooks.  It is also known as the V or wedge technique. Gynecologists and most plastic surgeons perform a labioplasty very differently. They essentially trim the labia minora (inner vaginal lips) and leave a long suture line instead of the normal labial edge. Their technique is the same whether a scalpel or a laser is used. This can lead to scallops and irregularities.  In contrast, the central wedge removes triangles of tissue and bring the normal edges together. Thus, the normal labial edges, normal color, and normal anatomy are preserved, but the darkest labial tissue is usually removed.  If you have extra tissue on your clitoral hood, it can be reduced it at the same time. No matter the technique, an inexperienced or unskilled surgeon can lead to a high rate of complications, chronic scar discomfort, labial deformities, and further surgery.  About 40% of the female genital cases I perform are revisions of labiaplasties and clitoral hoods botched by other doctors. Gary J. Alter, M.D.Beverly Hills, CA - Manhattan, NY","Gary J.

Once you decide on a change you desire and set up a list of expectations you and your surgeon agree on then the software is not very good at showing a fine tuned result, so is not helpful in my experience. Just understand that the rhinoplasty is based on anatomy the software can't necessarily see, and it is using photographic manipulations of a picture, so can at times generate anything you desire, but surgically those results may not be possible.

12371701,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding severe gluteal asymmetry or uneven buttocks. If you did not have trauma and the asymmetry was there as long as you can remember, I believe your condition is genetic or acquired. If it is genetic, you were born this way. It could have also been your position inside your mom's abdomen during her pregnancy. Additionally, it could've been trauma or a virus leading to muscle atrophy on your left buttock. Those could be the possible solutions. It would not be easy to exercise just one side. However, it is possible. Surgical solutions could make the smaller side or, the more significant side smaller. By this, I mean you can undergo a Brazilian butt lift with fat transfer to make your smaller buttock larger, or you could undergo a right buttock reduction either with liposuction or with a buttock lift. Therefore, I would suggest a surgical correction for your asymmetry. I hope this helps answer your question regarding buttock asymmetry. Sincerely, Dr. Katzen.

	Returning to regular daily&nbsp;activities&nbsp;after breast augmentation generally occurs in 3-5 days. This would not include vigorous house-cleaning or vacuuming as those repetitive motions would increase your swelling and therefore increase your pain. Helping a small child into a car seat or highchair could be done in a couple of days after surgery. If you are a mom with young children it would be advisable to have help for the first 2-3 days. The most common description moms give of the post-op pain after breast augmentation is the pain of breast&nbsp;engorgement&nbsp;after delivery. Generally my patients take pain medication for the first 2-3 days after surgery. If your job is not strenuous then you could return to work in 5-7 days. Talk to your Plastic Surgeon about your return to exercise.

	Scars tend to get thicker, red and noticeable for the first 6 to 9 weeks, and then get softer, flatter and paler over the next 6 to 9 months. Breast skin tends to heal very well so noticeable scars are unusual.

	Leaving either basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma untreated is not a good idea. Basal cell carcinoma grows slowly, destroying the normal healthy tissue around it. It can travel along nerves and destroy important structures so it&#39;s better to treat it with one of many techniques available. Rarely after years of no treatment or inadequate treatment it can metastasize or spread to other organs.

	Squamous cell carcinoma does have a risk to metastasis. The risk is higher for recurrent cancers and cancers that are more aggressive under the microscope. The risk is also higher for squamous cell carcinoma on certain locations such as the lips, ears and genitalia.

	There are many good options available for treatment of these skin cancers. Talk to your dermatologist about how to prevent skin cancer, what to look for, and if you develop a skin cancer, what are your options for treatment. The American Academy of Dermatology and the American College of Mohs Surgery has a lot of good resources available to help.

	As a dermatologic surgeon, I do not perform facelifts or neck lifts, but I do perform a large number of reconstructive cases on my Mohs surgery patients. Those patients who are taking Coumadin are told not to stop their medication but we work with their internist or cardiologist to maintain their INR in a reasonable level. This type of surgery, for skin cancer, improves the benefit to risk ratio but elective cosmetic surgery does not have such a good ratio because the need for surgery does not exist. There are times for reconstruction that the Coumadin can be stopped under supervision by the cardiologist and a replacement, short term blood thinner Lovenox, can be used to keep the blood thin while the coumadin&#39;s effect lowers. The surgery can then be done and the coumadin then is resumed. The problem with neck lifts is that their can be significant bleeding after the coumadin is resumed and a hematoma, blood collection, can cause very serious risks. If there is delayed bleeding, and the coumadin has been resumed, it&#39;s effect can&#39;t quickly be eliminated even after it&#39;s stopped because Coumadin&#39;s effect lasts long. In summary, NO, it&#39;s not worth the complication of having a STROKE by stopping coumadin for an elective cosmetic procedure. This decision should be ultimately up to you and your internist or cardiologist and/or cardiothoracic surgeon.

65873,question,,"With a conventional tummy tuck, considerable skin and fat is removed.  The upper and lower skin areas (flaps) are then pulled together.  This causes tightening in the upper flap, a desired effect, but can also elevate the mons area.  The more radical the tummy tuck, the greater this effect may be.  Most patients consider some mons elevation a plus, since the mons tends to &quot;sag&quot; after pregnancies.Shortly after surgery, there is swelling and firmness due to healing and swelling from the liposuction that is often performed at the same time as the tummy tuck.  Of course patients should make sure with their doctors that this swelling does not represent a collection of fluid, but that is easy to determine at your doctor's office during a postoperative check.Patients are often under the impression that making an extra low incision will leave the final incision lower, and therefore more concealed by a bikini-type garment.This can be false.The lower the incision, the more skin and fat must be removed, since the upper incision is above the belly button.  In many patients, especially patients with high belly buttons or thinner patients who have less excess skin and fat to be removed, this can cause excessive tightness. Excessive tightness leads to poor scarring and weird elevation and elongation of the pubic structures, an uncorrectable and disturbing problem.  Excessive tension on the incision also predisposes to poor wound healing and greatly increases the chance of the skin pulling apart, necessitating weeks or months of dressing changes.So every patient is different.  A skilled plastic surgeon can draw where the anticipated incisions will be during surgery, and estimate where your final incision will be.It is not realistic for every patient to have a &quot;bikini incision&quot; after a full tummy tuck.","Brent Moelleken, MD answers: Pubic area appears bigger after Tummy Tuck",/question/pubic-area-appears-bigger-after-tummy-tuck

	Thanks for your question. The upper abdomen is addressed with a tummy tuck. Basically, the skin and excess fat at the lower abdomen is excised, and then the upper skin is 'pulled down', tightening the entire abdomen. The skin from about an inch above your belly button down to just above the mons is all taken away: so any stretch marks or cellulite in that zone will be gone. Any stretch marks or cellulite above that will still be there after the surgery. The other major component of this surgery is to tighten the abdominal muscles, which helps that lower pooch that is so common after pregnancy, or a large weight loss. Good luck!

	This is VERY Normal to have the mons become swollen, bruised and enlarged following abdominal surgery. &nbsp;Everything drains downward and the catch all is the mons. This area will often become enlarged and discolored and stay that way for quite some time. &nbsp;You also can have a vessel in that area bleed a fair amount with the placement of the drains. &nbsp;This is very common and will fully resolve. &nbsp;If you had liposuction of this area, it is more likely to have manifest swelling. &nbsp;Hardness would reflect either clotted blood or scar tissue inseting following the liposuction. &nbsp;In all cases, it will resolve.

	Pain control following any procedure is critical. I recommend the patient&#39;s take Ibuprophen 800 mg every 6 hours and add to this 1-2 Vicoden or equivalent narcotic as needed. The Ibuprophen will reduce the need for the narcotic by up to 50%. &nbsp;It is important to be up and moving and control the pain well. The pain will resolve on it&#39;s own.&nbsp;

	&quot;Skin tightening&quot; procedures, namely laser-type therapies or injection treatments, do NOT address the underlying issue of a Mom&#39;s tummy after she has had multiple pregnancies:

	
		Excess skin and fat
	
		Stretch marks
	
		&quot;Rectus diastasis&quot; = separation of the muscles of the abdominal wall away from one another, creating loss of muscle tone and a bulge


	Only a surgical procedure, abdominoplasty (and/or liposuction in some cases), can address each of these factors.

	Beware of smooth-talking salespeople who do their best to get you to sign up for a &quot;package deal&quot; of procedures.

	Often, minimally invasive therapies such as these prey on those Moms who are frightened of surgery and are looking for a quick fix with supposedly less downtime and fewer scars.

The decision to remove or keep the hair extensions in place during surgery will depend on several factors, including the surgical area, the type of anesthesia being used, and the surgeon's preferences.Here are a few considerations:Surgical Area: Depending on the extent of your Mommy makeover surgery and the areas being treated (such as the abdomen, breasts, and mons pubis), your surgeon may advise removing the hair extensions to ensure optimal access to the surgical sites and to prevent interference with the procedure.Anesthesia: If you will be undergoing general anesthesia for the Mommy makeover surgery, your surgeon may prefer to remove the hair extensions to avoid any potential issues with the placement of anesthesia equipment or monitoring devices during the procedure.Comfort and Convenience: Removing the hair extensions before surgery may make the procedure more comfortable for you and may also simplify post-operative care and recovery.Reattachment: If you choose to remove the hair extensions before surgery, you can discuss options for reattaching them after you have fully recovered from the procedure. Your hairstylist or the salon where you had the extensions applied can provide guidance on reattachment.It's crucial to communicate openly with your plastic surgeon about any concerns or questions you have regarding your hair extensions and their potential impact on the Mommy makeover surgery.

Most importantly it does not require the horizontal component scars that the anchor-lift requires and breasts appear much more natural, lifted, and less boxy. Lastly, the lift lasts longer because the lollipop doesn't rely on the skin to hold the breast up, its actually breast tissue thats being brought together to support the breast and hence improves longevity.

	Skin cancer removal options depend on the type, size, histology, and equally importantly, the location of the tumors. With malignant melanoma, wide-excision with adequate margins must be performed. You have more options with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or basal cell carcinoma (BCC); both of which are known as non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). For NMSC on face, scalp, and neck and those with aggressive histology, Mohs micrographic surgery is advisable. For a cosmetic sensitive area such as the upper chest, one must balance the desire to achieve a cure and best aesthetic outcome. If you only have one to deal with at a time on the upper chest, curettage followed by excision by a skilled dermatologic surgeon should be fine. However, if you have 3 to work with on the chest at one time, electrodessication and curettagematologist recommended is reasonable. I would also recommend application of imiquimod for 4-6 weeks afterwards to maximize cure rate as well as the cosmetic outcome.

	At this relatively early stage it&#39;s not necessarily a cause for concern.

	As always, it is difficult to assess this without seeing what you looked like before and knowing exactly what surgery was done - surgical excision, lipo of surrounding areas including the mons, etc.&nbsp; If nothing was done to the area and it was a little full before, then the excessive swelling is completely to be expected.&nbsp; And it can take a while for everything to settle down - several weeks for most of it, several months for all of it.

	If, however, at several months that area is still relatively fuller, then you may want to touch base with your PS to see what, if anything, can be done.&nbsp; If lipo of the mons was not done as part of the TT you could consider having it done as an additional procedure; if it was done and there is still some fat, you may want to have a bit more taken out.

	Regardless of the approach, you should contact your PS and discuss this with him or her to make sure that the two of you remain on the same page.

There are even fillers that can be used directly to correct lines in the cheeks.Mole removal can be accomplished by laser treatment or completely excising&nbsp;(cutting out) the mole. Lasers can minimize the appearance of a mole but only a surgical removal will completely get rid of all the cells.

3663275,question,,"Hi, tsamuel98Thank youfor your question.Mommy makeover is a combination surgery, usually with breast augmentation/lift/reduction and tummy tuck. It is a very common surgery for many moms to regain and improve their body after pregnancy.Any surgery will have recovery time and some degree of pain. Pain is something very subjective. Some people have a very high pain threshold; some others have a low pain threshold and may require taking pain medication for a while. Your surgeon can employ different surgical technique to help alleviate some of the pain as well.In general, mommy makeover or any body contouring procedure should be performed on a good candidate. A good candidate for surgery is someone 1) who is medically, emotionally, and socially optimized for the surgery, and 2) who has reached her goal weight. I advised my patients to reach their goal weight, not necessarily the ideal weight. I want to give the best result for my patients who can maintain their surgical outcome. My priority for my patients is their safety and outcome.Please consult a board-certified plastic surgeon to discuss whether you are a good candidate for the procedure and to learn about the procedure.Best regards.","Sugene Kim, MD, FACS answers: How painful is it after a mommy makeover?",/question/spring-tx-painful-after-mommy-makeover
12574770,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding what you should do about your tummy, upper back, breasts, upper arms, inner thighs, mons, and uneven butt. First, congratulations on losing weight. It would be wonderful if you could get to down 175 lbs. You would need to maintain that weight for three months before getting skin removal surgery. It doesnt make sense to get skin removal surgery while your weight is still fluctuating. That being said, once youve hit your weight goal, I recommend getting a lower body lift first. This would address the tummy, hips, buttocks, and mons region. We start on the back side, and an incision is made from one hip over the buttock to the other hip and resect a butterfly-shaped area of skin and fat. Once thats done, the patient is flipped over and we begin on the tummy. We make an incision from one hip to the other, direct upwards and plicate the six pack muscle. The incision will then connect over your hip (with the incision over your buttocks). Please visit my website to see this for yourself. This can be combined with an inner medial thigh lift where in incision is made from the groin to above the knee (on the inseam of where your pants would be). 4 to 6 weeks after your lower body lift and thigh lift, I would recommend an upper body lift. You could choose between vertical or horizontal torosoplasty. A vertical torsoplasty incision would be from your armpit, down the side of your body, giving you an hourglass figure and getting rid of any excess skin over the side of your tummy, back, and love handles. Your tubular breasts can also be corrected during this procedure with breast implants. You could potentially do fat transfer to the breast, but it doesnt look like you have too much fat. Breast implants might be the best way to go if you want significant results.I hope this helps answer your question about what procedures you can get done and in what order. Good luck on your journey to get to 175 pounds. You got this. I specialize in reconstructive plastic surgery after weight loss.  If you have any more questions regarding the lower body lift, 360 circumferential lower body lift, belt lipectomy, belt abdominoplasty, or belt dermolipectomy please contact my office. Since the body lift is a big procedure, please seek an experienced, board certified plastic surgeonwith significant experience performing the lower body lift. Do your research.

	Assuming you are the husband, kudos for a great question. We see a lot of husbands who don&#39;t get that the wife wants the surgery for her own reasons, and your role is to provide support for her decision even though you love her the way she is. After surgery she will need both emotional and practical support. It is not uncommon for there to be a case of the blues a few days after surgery but this is temporary. On a practical level, keeping track of her medication schedule, output in the drain tubes if they are used, help getting up to the bathroom, meals, and any childcare responsibilities. Moms often have a hard time being on the receiving end rather than being the caregiver.

	Congratulations on your decision! Breast Augmentation is one of the surgeries with the shortest recovery period. I have performed this surgery on many women on a Thurs or Fri and had them return to work on a Mon. But be careful. I advise patients to wait a full 6 weeks before heavy lifting, in order to allow full healing of the implant pocket and incision. This is so the implant does not displace out of position.&nbsp; While this is what I advise, many woman simply can't avoid lifting (because of young children or their job). So I advise to do so cautiously. I would recommend you follow your board certified plastic surgeons advice. Good Luck!

	Assuming you are in good health and there are no extenuating circumstances, it is &quot;possible&quot; and many times desirable to perform these surgeries in one setting. I frequently and safely perform &quot;mommy makeovers&quot; in an outpatient setting using one anesthetic. This allows mom to undergo one time off of work/child care, one anesthetic and certainly less costs. However, not all patients fit this description and not all surgeons are comfortable with this approach. Ask your surgeon for patients that you may contact to discuss their experience.

6789833,question,,"Dear patient, It is important to know what material was used to augment your lips. The treatment really varies depending on what was used and how long ago the treatment was performed. Occasional Hyaluronic acid compounds (Restylane, Juvederm etc) can ball up and cause small bumps. These usually resolve in a couple of weeks with massage or dilute injection of a steroid anti-inflammatory solution called kenelog.&nbsp; Another option is to dissolve the Hyaluronic acid completely with a protein called Hyaluronidase. This is injected directly into the affected area. Results are quite impressive and visible within 2-3 days. Another condition that is much more difficult to treat is called 'Bio-film. We don't exactly understand why some patients basically develop a hard film around the implants in their lips/face! These nodules are also injected with Kenelog steroid, treated with Oral antibiotics, and anti-metabolites such as 5FU. If several injections over a few weeks does not dissolve the nodules they can be excised. Finally; non FDA products such as Silicone and Bioalcamid (seen more frequently in Mexico and South America) don't respond well to steroid injections and can cause severe deformities. These granulomas need to be excised. There is always scarring and downtime with excision of these inflammatory nodules in the lip and I perform it as a last resort. Look for a surgical Dermatologist&nbsp;in your area. There is also a sub-specialty within Dermatology called Mohs Surgery. These Dermatologist specialize in skin cancer surgery and are usually very skilled when it comes to removing lesions on or within lips. I hope this was helpful. Yours, Dr David R.","A.

One, I have my patients keep their garment on until their first follow up a couple of days after surgery to ensure there is no opportunity for no compression. The second reason involves drains. If you have drains which typically are inserted in the mons area right below the incision, it is smart to allow them to come through the hole in the garment. If you try to bring them up through the top of the garment, and your abdomen is numb, it could possibly dig into the skin and cause wound healing complications. Once drains are removed, I allow my patients to wear spanks without a hole as long as the areas that were liposuctioned have compression on them.

	In cases where patient benefits more from two step implant surgery (rather than one), we place implant and cover it with a gum first. We wait for complete integration, depending on area&nbsp;waiting time can be from 3 to 6 moth.&nbsp;And then we have second procedure which is called implant uncovering, where surgeon would put a healing abutment of the implant, so that the soft tissue around it could completely heal. If implant is in aesthetic area your restorative doctor might put a provisional crown to create a good contour and condition the tissues. And that would be it with a two step implant surgery.

1596377,question,,"In my practice, I delay surgery if a patient smokes one cigarette 7 days before a procedure than involves elevating skin, such as facelift, breast reduction, breast lift, and tummy tuck. In my first year of practice, I did a breast reconstruction procedure on a patient who swore she'd had just one cigarette two weeks before surgery. The skin on the tummy tissue I had moved up to her breast turned white as a sheet. The vessels were fine, but they were in severe spasm. After 45 minutes, the skin pinked up, and I completed the operation. The tissue healed, but a lot of the fat turned hard from the poor blood supply.Since then I tell patients who smoke a cigarette soon before surgery to start the clock ticking again. For procedures at high risk of tissue death from poor blood supply, I require no nicotine in any form for six weeks. I don't have that same requirement for other procedures with no tissue elevation, such as liposuction or upper eyelid surgery, are at very low risk for tissue death. The risk varies with the procedure.I paint a clear picture for patients who smoke about the consequences of nicotine exposure too close to surgery. For a tummy tuck, their lower skin can die; for a breast lift/breast reduction, their nipples can die; for facelifts, their cheek skin can die. I ask them to please confess if they smoke at a weak moment and not to feel embarrassed about delaying their surgery. The consequences of taking a gamble are just not worth it.

To accentuate the nasal tip and straighten the septum, if current septal cartilage falls short we prefer to use harvested rib cartilage. If nostril/ala definition is desired then a more moldable, supple conchal cartilage (harvested from the ear) is sufficient as it will create better definition. Also a filler is a good idea for you to understand the end result of your potential rhinoplasty. If a HA filler is being used my advice is to wait 6 months for surgery - if a Saline filler is being used for demonstration then a month is more than sufficient to undergo the procedure.

	Most women have permanent changes to their bodies after pregnancy.

	These changes can include:

	Stretch marks
	Loose lower abdominal skin
	Rectus diastasis - separation of the rectus abdominis muscles
	Loss of abdominal muscle tone
	Excess fat in the abdomen and flanks
	Multiple pregnancies and having twins or multiple babies born at one time can magnify the effects of pregnancy on the abdomen.

	Although some women are blessed with genetics that enable their bodies to bounce back quickly after pregnancy, most moms have at least some of these changes after having children.

	There is really no good way to prevent these natural changes of pregnancy. Topical lotions and potions do not work, unfortunately.

	Maintaining physical fitness, a healthy weight before and during pregnancy, and good muscle tone can all promote speedy recovery from pregnancy but are not a guarantee that your abdomen won't change after you are a Mom.

	For Moms who have finished having children and are at least 6 months out from their last birth, a tummy tuck (abdominoplasty) can help to correct excess abdominal skin, permanently remove stretch marks, tighten muscle tone and recreate the firm, toned abdomen most women would love to show off!

	Get physically fit and do as much as you can to achieve your personal goals regarding your weight and muscle tone before considering any surgery.

	You should be in optimal shape both physically and mentally/emotionally, with support from your partner if you are going to undergo any procedure.

Like all things, ...this too will pass. After turning all colors of the rainbow for the next 1-2 weeks, the blood will be resorbed into your system, andthe end products of the bleed (iron and blood proteins) will be well used by your bone marrow to form new red blood cells and, after a slightly longer recovery period than first anticipated you'll be, most likely, good as new!

And although our skin has an amazing ability to tighten, many women find that the skin around their stomach stays loose after giving birth.There are many surgical and nonsurgical options for skin tightening. Nonsurgical treatments, can help tighten excess skin on the stomach by heating the dermal layers and boosting collagen production. However, these treatments are often not effective enough to treat loose skin after multiple pregnancies.The tummy tuck procedure (abdominoplasty) was designs to address loose skin after pregnancies or major weight loss.

Most of the pain will be due to the tummy tuck portion of the surgery rather than the other procedures. The doctor will prescribe pain medication and protocols which are helpful for healing and important to follow. Additionally, the surgeons technique and time taken during the surgery can have a big impact on post-op pain and healing speed. Make sure you do your research to find a surgeon who is gentle with tissue and meticulous with their techniques, rather than someone who rushes or is unnecessarily rough.Most patients are alert after their surgeries. They are not comatose, and it is preferred that they are moving around, taking their meals, and going to the bathroom after their surgery. Pain medications are quite helpful for the first few days. There are also other options (ex. TAP block) to help with excessive pain that you can learn more about from your surgeon.Your surgeon should provide you with documents laying out the details of your limitations post-surgery. Generally, the first week is meant for you to really lay low and focus on healing. The second week post-op can be more of a transition week, so you could start moving around more and doing tasks with the help of others.

	The ultimate goal is to maximize patient safety. You need a cooperative patient and great nursing to do these procedures under local anesthesia. The anesthesiologist also needs to be present to babysit the patient and to be available in case of an emergency. The risk is generally dictated by the overall health of your father. A preoperative evaluation by the anesthesia staff is probably a wise choice where you will be better educated on the risks and benefits of general vs. local anesthesia.&nbsp;

	I can not&nbsp;see any reason why a skin graft on a nose can not be done under local anesthesia. Any plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery should be able to do this.

	I agree with you in that your tummy tuck scar does look rather high, even though you have a very nice tummy tuck result overall. &nbsp;The best way to lower your abdominal scar is to wait at least six months to one year after your initial tummy tuck, then have a revisionary surgery to excise a couple centimeters of skin from below your lower abdominal scar. &nbsp;This will not only lower the tummy tuck scar that you currently have, but it will also raise and slightly flatten your mons as well. &nbsp;Best of luck.

8650579,question,,"Thanks for the question. I agree that its a bit too early to tell and theres definitely significant swelling during the early period immediate post-surgery. It will take time for the implants to settle into its final position and also for the tissue swelling to resolve. Side-boob or side cleavage is something the surgeon can plan to achieve deliberately after an augmentation. It does depend on what you are starting with, the implant size and type and the placement of the implant. Not every patient will have or is suitable for the outer side breast cleavage after augmentation. Everyone is unique and there are several factors to consider if side cleavage is ideal.During my consultations with my patients, one of the considerations is the side boob. This isnt a medical term but it seems to be the rage now as celebrities and influencers popularise it on social media. So what is it anyway ? Side boob simply means a glimpse of the side of the breasts and its essentially cleavage and breast projection from the side. Having a side boob usually means that the side part of your breasts extends beyond the edge of your body to where your arms are. If you draw a vertical line down from your armpit crease, the extra show of breast curve you can see beyond this line in bikinis,sleeveless dresses and tank tops - thats the side boob. Side boob can be sexy if it is well-intentioned.Side boob is something some women want to achieve after breast augmentation and if you are considering breast augmentation it will be good to bring this up so that you can discuss it with your surgeon. There are a few considerations on whether you will have side boob (visible side cleavage) after surgery:Existing breast size and location on the chest wall. Depending on the current breast size, presence and absence of central and side cleavage, you will be able to select an ideal implantsize and shape. Exact pocket dissection and placement of the implant will then be able to create the sidecleavage.Existing nipple position andwidth of the chest bone (sternum). The existing nipple position specificallyhow far apart they arewill affect the aesthetics of the augmentation. In certain body types, it may not be aesthetic to have a side cleavage.Softtissue coverage and how your skin is able to handle the increased volume of the implant. If you are very thin, you may not be suitable for side cleavage as the implant may be visible. Options of a hybrid technique using fat grafts may help.Implant size and position. Depending on the implant size, andpositionof implant you can get central cleavage, side cleavage or both. Certainly if you want both, the implant may need to be of a certain size.Of the above mentioned factors, the most important factor that can be controlled is the dissection of the breast pocket. Pre-operative planning and selection ofimplants to match your body shape and breasts is critical. During surgery, the creation of a precise and perfectly symmetrical breast pocket is critical. During the placement ofimplants under the chest muscle, I make sure the muscle is detached the same way such that the pocketcreated are identical. (Some of the revisions I haveperformed haveasymmetry because the muscle is released differently on each side) The pocket has to be precise so that the implant position is well controlled and does not slip out to the side. That creates another set ofproblems where theimplants are too wide apart and the nipples are pointing too far out. The patient is sat up during surgery to confirm theimplants are located exactly where we want them, to check the symmetry and then the patient is lay down again and thisposition is again verified from the foot of the bed. Post-surgery, patients are given a specific recovery protocol and placed in a recovery bra for 4 weeks.Be patient with your recovery and check back with your surgeon. It does takes some time for the swelling to resolve and for your body to recover from thesurgery.All the best!

The other questions you need to ask, ( which I am sure your mom has) is Will my beasts continue to grow? What happens when I have kids? How big will my breasts get? Will I be able to breast feed? . These are all questions I like to address with the patient and her mom or parents. It's usually the mom who accompanies young women considering this surgery.Insurance companies require lots and lots of documentation in order for them to even consider paying for a breast reduction. Some insurance companies actually exclude breast reduction as a covered procedure. If it's a covered procedure then pre-op photos need to be submitted. The patient must have had a prior history of a year's worth of conservative therapy by their private doctor, frequentky insurance companies will require that you have also established a medical record with either an orthopedic surgeon or chiropractor documenting your sympoms and most important is that a minimum of 500 grams must be removed at the time of surgery. This simply means that unless you have enough tissue they will not even consider it. A letter from an insurance company that it's a covered procedure does not necessarily mean that they will pay for it. Depending on an insurance company to pay for your breast reduction is like spinning the roulette wheel.Always seek out the opinion of a surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery with years of experience in cosmetic breast surgery. Furthermore request to see before and after photos of previous patients by that doctor....not a clinic or surgery center. Do your homework......research and verify the doctor's credentials. Have they had problems with the Board of Medicine, disciplinary or otherwise. Any law suits?How about the center, clinic or facility? Are they accredited by a national organization or do they just have State approval. Understand that at the current time, there are three nationally recognized organizations responsible for the highest levels of patient safety, AAAASF, AAACH and JCHO. You owe it to yourself to position yourself for the best possible results but under the most stringent safety regulations, If you have kids, even more so.How about anesthesia? Will you have a medical doctor certified by the American Board of Anesthesiology or a certified nurse anesthetist (CRNA)? Understand that there is no substitute for research. Cosmetic surgery, no matter how simple it may be to the patients, are invasive procedures and as such carry certain risks and complications.In our office, as in others, we use TouchMD which is a web based program in which patients have the ability to load their picture unto the program. The surgen can actually draw on the picture to show a potential patient where the incisions would be located and how the procedure is to be realized. It's all done to comply with HIPPA which is the federal law that protects the patient's medical information. Look them up.Good luck, Dr PG","Jose Perez-Gurri, MD, FACS answers: Will insurance cover a breast lift if there actually is a medical/non-cosmetic reason?",/question/fort-lauderdale-fl-insurance-cover-breast-lift-medical-cosmetic-reason
9017380,question,,"There are a variety of proceduresthat can produce a good cosmetic result in the appropriate patient:a mini tummy tuck, a modified with an umbilical float, or a variety of a full abdominoplasty.All of the tummy tuck variations may or may not include tightening of the muscle and liposuction. Generally if there is significant loose skin above the umbilicus (belly button), a full tummy tuck will result in a greater correction and better outcome. Nonsurgical procedures or liposuction alone will mot produce a reliable cosmetic improvement in a patient with your anatomy.Keep in mind that following the advice from a surgeon on this or any other website who proposes to tell you exactly what to do based on limitedphotos without examining you, physically feeling the tissue, assessing your desired outcome, taking a full medical history, and discussing the pros and cons of each operative procedure would not be in your best interest.

There are a few things that can be done, however, it depends on what you actually mean by your vagina. I am assuming you mean 1 out of 2 things.

1716448,question,,"This scar should be improved with a combination of subscision, fractional laser and possibly filler.&nbsp;Post-traumatic scars are treated with an approach that is similar to acne scars, chicken pox scars and post-surgical scars.&nbsp;My starting point is typically subscision, performed under local anesthesia, whereby a very thin needle with a scalpel-type end is inserted into the indented scar and this tissue is loosened through a gentle back and forth motion. New collagen is laid down in this area, helping to fill the indented area. This process takes about a month or so and I anticipate several sessions.&nbsp;If the improvement is incomplete, the sharp edges of the scar can be blurred with fractional laser or microneedling. Fillers such as Juvederm are helpful as well. Although they are temporary, they tend to last longer as compared with injections in sites such as lips and melolabial folds (perhaps because scar tissue is densely collagenized).Finally, there is emerging data to suggest that platelet-rich plasma (PRP) infusion, in combination with fractional laser, can improve acne scars. PRP helps to regenerate collagen and soft tissue though local infusion of platelet derived growth factors.* The statements above are not intended as a replacement for authentic medical advice; an in-person medical visit with a formally trained dermatologist is recommended.*Kenneth W.

Dr. Lockwood's brilliant addition to this surgery was anchoring the resultant scar to the periosteum of the pelvic bones, thereby keeping the scar from migrating down the thigh and outside of a bathing suit line.Unless a patient has had significant weight loss, the scar down the length of the thigh is unnecessary because of Dr. Lockwood's innovation. When looking for a medial thigh tuck surgeon, be sure to see before and after photographs and discuss with potential medial thigh tuck surgeons the exact nature of the proposed surgery and how will complications be handled.With reference to vaginal tightening, intra vaginal muscle repairs are fraught with complications and intra vaginal laser and radio frequency procedures rarely give a long term improvement.

7777844,question,,"I assume, from your explanation, that you had a partial closure of your forehead Mohs surgery wound. Having staples, which should not be used on the face, and stitches removed after ten days will likelyleave suture and staple marks, which is unfortunate. The yellow substance is serous drainage from the healing wound. This should be cleaned out on a daily or twice daily basis or it can make the wound painful and delay the healing process. When allowing wounds to heal by second intention, my patients are instructed to clean out all yellowish material using sterile normal saline and cotton-tipped applicators. The wound will then heal from the bottom up by filling the wound with granulation tissue. This is healing tissue very rich in blood vessels to the extent that it resembles watermelon. When this has reached the surface, my patients are instructed to stop all rubbing and begin just blotting the wound so as not to disrupt new skin coming from the outside in to cover and contract the wound. Your wound is now probably depressed and the serous drainage has solidified, making cleaning it out almost impossible. In order to allow the wound to heal normally, this solidified center of the wound should probably be excised under local anesthesia and allowed to re-heal as I described above.

However, please keep in mind that an in-person consultation with physical exam is first necessary before any legitimate analysis or final surgical recommendations can be made.  Indeed liposuction of your mons pubis is a good option to better lean it out and harmonize with your tummy tuck result. Options for cosmetic enhancement of the labia majora typically include reduction of excess/loose skin (tucking) and/or fat transfer. In general, i have found patients to be more satisfied with the results of tucking. The results of fat transfer aremore unpredictable, unreliable and can be uneven and/or leave behind hard painful cysts of scar tissue under the skin.In rare cases a combination may be indicated. Once a physical exam is performed to determine the balance of deflation to loose skin and remaining skin elasticity, then the best recommendation can be given.

There are several reasons why this might happen:1. Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation: Any trauma to the skin, including surgical procedures, can trigger inflammation, which may lead to hyperpigmentation in the affected area. This is more common in individuals with darker skin tones.2. Changes in Blood Supply: Surgical procedures like liposuction and lower body lift can disrupt the blood supply to the area, leading to changes in skin coloration. This can result in temporary or permanent discoloration.3. Hormonal Changes: Fluctuations in hormone levels, which can occur in response to surgery and changes in body composition, may also affect skin pigmentation.4. Sun Exposure: Exposure to sunlight can exacerbate pigmentation changes in the skin. It's essential to protect the treated area from the sun during the healing process to minimize the risk of darkening.5. Scarring: Scar tissue formation following surgery can sometimes result in changes in skin pigmentation, including darkening of the skin.If you're concerned about changes in pigmentation after your surgery, it's important to discuss them with your plastic surgeon. They can evaluate the area, provide guidance on appropriate skincare and sun protection, and address any potential complications or concerns.

Based on your pictures and your history weight loss, I would suggest a 360 circumferential lower body lift combined with a longitudinal vertical medial thigh with thigh liposuction. These procedures can be combined as one surgery performed under general anesthesia on an outpatient or inpatient basis. During the 360 circumferential lower body lift, the abdomen is flattened by the removal of excess skin and fat of the abdomen. The mons region is also lifted and reduced. The hips are also lifted and reduced. The outer thighs are lifted, and the cellulite is diminished. Also, the buttock is lifted and reduced during a 360 body lift. Often I perform the thigh lift at the same time. However, if you wish, the thigh lift can be postponed for a secondary surgery approximately one or two months later. During the longitude vertical medial thigh lift, thigh liposuction is done from the groin to the knee. Then a large elliptical area of skin and fat is removed from the inner thigh to the knee. This will get rid of the excess skin and fat on the inner thigh. For these combined procedures, plan a 2 to 3 weeks recovery. Youll need to wear compression garments for approximately six weeks. You can probably return to a sitting type of job at approximately 2 to 3 weeks. More active jobs require a longer recovery, perhaps 3 to 4 weeks.All in all, these are very rewarding procedures, and you should obtain significant improvement in your body shape.

13094650,question,,"Yes, it's possible to undergo a breast lift, extended tummy tuck, and pubic lift in a single surgical session, especially if your surgeon determines that you're a suitable candidate for these combined procedures.A breast lift (mastopexy) aims to lift and reshape sagging breasts, addressing issues like drooping or loss of volume. An extended tummy tuck is a variation of the traditional tummy tuck (abdominoplasty) that involves more extensive contouring and tightening of the abdominal area, often addressing excess skin and tissue not only in the abdomen but also extending to the flanks and lower back. A pubic lift is a procedure designed to address sagging or drooping of the mons pubis, which is the area above the genital region.Combining these procedures can have advantages, such as minimizing overall recovery time and allowing for comprehensive rejuvenation of the body. However, it's crucial to consider the potential risks and challenges associated with undergoing multiple surgeries simultaneously. These may include a longer initial recovery period, increased post-operative discomfort, and a higher risk of complications compared to having each surgery separately.Before proceeding with multiple procedures at once, it's essential to have a thorough consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon. They will assess your individual anatomy, medical history, and goals to determine if you're a suitable candidate for combined surgery. Your surgeon will also discuss the potential benefits, risks, and expected outcomes of having these procedures together versus staging them separately.Always prioritize your safety and well-being when considering cosmetic surgeries, and ensure you fully understand the implications of combining multiple procedures before making a decision.","Emmanuel De La Cruz, MD answers: Can you get a breast lift, extended tummy tuck and pubic lift at the same time?",/question/sacramento-california-breast-lift-extended-tummy-tuck-pubic-lift-time

	Of course it is possible to omit muscle repair and just resect excess skin and the fat attached to the skin. If your abdomen is relatively flat now when standing and NOT holding your muscles tight that may be the right choice for you. But see a aurgeon for an exam and if the muscles are separated (he can easily tell when examining you) and there is some roundness to your abdomen, you will get a more satisfying result. In our practice we do not charge more when doing the muscle repair. It does make for a mor painful surgery but with the pain pumps that we have used for several years, the discomfort is very well controlled.

	A &quot;Mommy Makeover&quot; seeks to improve a woman&#39;s figure after childbearing

	The range of changes seen after pregnancy and nursing is wide, with many women not having major problems. For those that do see significant deflation or sagging of the breasts or that have damage to the tummy skin or stretching of the muscle wall, surgery will often offer the most powerful option for improvement.

	For moms that have had significant damage to the tissues, unfortunately, even thousands of sit-ups and hundreds of miles of running will not reverse these changes.

	While a Mommy Makeover most commonly refers to combining a Tummy Tuck with a Breast Augmentation using implants (silicone gel or saline), basically any combined procedures to improve the breast and body shape can be called a Mommy Makeover surgery.

	The results of liposuction should be close to the &quot;final&quot; results between 3 to 4 months after the procedure. In general, there should be a noticeable improvement in the first week after surgery. You swelling improves significantly 3 to 4 weeks after surgery and you should notice a weight loss close to the amount of fat aspirated. Most post-operative photos are taken 4 to 5 moths following liposuction.

	The amount of fat removed during liposuction will affect your results. Removal of 600 cc&#39;s in an extremely fit individual, as is done in an abdominal etching procedure, will produce a nice result. Removal of this amount in a heavier individual will produce a less dramatic result. I would recommend discussing your concerns with you Plastic Surgeon.

	Most surgical repairs after Mohs leave minimal scarring. Following your doctor&#39;s would care instructions is often all you need in order to obtain a superior cosmetic outcome. However, occasionally more prominent scarring will occur. There are a number of treatments to reduce scarring. My highest recommendation is to apply sunscreen over the area, as scar can darken and become more noticeable in the sun. Silicone dressings often help lubricate the scar and promote skin healing. Other find benefit by applying Vitamin E to the scar. Thicker scar can be injected with intralesional steroids to make them shrink down. Pulse dye laser can be used to help reduce any redness in the scar, or broken blood vessels that sometimes develop around the scar tissue. Other laser devices like fractionated resurfacing can help blend the scar (almost like airbrushing) in with the surrounding skin. Regardless of which treatment you chose, you should always consult and work closely with your doctor to get the best result. Some of these treatments should not be attempted for a number of weeks or even months after your surgery is performed. Good luck.

	I have to respectfully disagree with my Plastic Surgery colleagues that a Plastic Surgeon will do a better job in removing this mole than a Dermatologist who specializes in Dermatologic and Cosmetic Surgery.&nbsp; I believe the most important criteria is the experience of your doctor rather than the type of training or years of training.&nbsp; A Board certified dermatologist and fellowship trained Dermatologic and Mohs Surgeon have to complete five years of training after medical school.&nbsp; This includes one year of intensive advanced skin cancer fellowship in which most of us perform well over 1000 cases of skin cancer surgery and reconstruction.&nbsp; So I would argue that a well trained Dermatologic Surgeon would do an equally great job given their experience.

You state that you had a hematoma after surgery, but you don't mention if it was drained. A hematoma is a blood collection after surgery.

When there is a hematoma the resulting subcutaneous tissue can be come quite firm especially if it is not drained.Firm areas of the underlying skin flaps and incisions&nbsp; generally develop 10 to 12 days surgery. This healing ridge is normal. The area will soften on its own, but can take 6 to 8 weeks to resolve, even longer if there is a hematoma.If the area is especially firm or uncomfortably you can use ultrasound to soften it.

13042969,question,,"Hi BettyPie om Indianapolis, Thank you for your question regarding whether a LBL and a FDL can be performed together. Thank you for your history and your pictures. Congratulations on your 162-pound weight loss! Great job. Let us clarify that LBL stands for lower body lift and FDL stands for fleur-de-lis abdominoplasty.Now lets look at what the lower body lift (LBL) entails. The lower body lift entails a tummy tuck or abdominoplasty, abdominis rectus muscle plication, pubic or mons lift and reduction, hip lift and reduction, and buttock lift and reduction. A lower body lift results in an incision that goes 360 circumferentially around your body. Indeed, some plastic surgeons term the 360-degree circumferential lower body lift a belt lipectomy. This is because the incision goes around you like a belt.Now, lets look at what the fleur-de-lis (FDL) includes. The fleur-de-lis abdominoplasty includes a horizontal abdominoplasty, a vertical abdominoplasty, abdominis rectus plication, and a pubic or mons lift and reduction. The fleur-de-lis abdominal plasty does not include a hip lift and reduction, nor a buttock lift and reduction.Therefore, when you combine the lower body lift and a fleur-de-lis, there is a lot of overlay.Including a fleur-de-lis to a lower body lift just adds the vertical component. The vertical incision extends from the top of the pubic region to the bottom of the sternum. The lower body lift and the fleur-de-lis are often performed together. This leads to a dramatic reconstruction of the anterior abdominal wall, especially after massive weight loss.In regards to the excess skin on your back, I would suggest a horizontal torsoplasty. I would suggest this be performed at a separate surgery after the lower body lift and fleur-de-lis abdominoplasty.  A horizontal torsoplasty is also called a bra strap lift and is made with an incision that goes horizontally across your back. Typically, the incision is hidden under a bra.  I hope that I helped to answer your question about whether a lower body lift (LBL) and a fleur-de-lis (FDL) can be performed together. Good luck.Sincerely, J.

	A lower body lift is a combination of procedures that is designed to improve the appearance of your abdomen, lateral thighs, buttocks, posterior thighs, and mons pubis. &nbsp;It is a procedure that is not performed frequently by all plastic surgeons and therefore consultation with a plastic surgeon who specializes in surgery after massive weight loss is recommended. &nbsp;If done properly this surgery can be a tremendously positive experience. &nbsp;The cost of a lower body lift will include the surgeons fees, anesthesia fees, and operating room fees for all of the procedures listed above. &nbsp;Be prepare to pay around 20K give or take depending on the area of the country where you are at, but remember....not all lower body lifts are created equal, not all plastic surgeons are experts in lower body lifts, and always pay more for a better product with better safety.

	All the best,

12287423,question,,"If you are planning on having children in the next year, then I would wait on having breast augmentation surgery until afterwards.  If having children is further out in your timeline, then you can proceed with breast augmentation whenever you feel ready.  The breasts will be enlarged during pregnancy and breast feeding.  It is best to wait at least 6 months after completion of breast feeding to allow the breast to return to its final size and shape.  At that time, you and your plastic surgeon can make a plan to address any concerns about your breasts.  If you did have a breast augmentation beforehand, know that pregnancy and breastfeeding after breast augmentation are safe for mom and baby.  The ability to exclusively breastfeed your baby (ie no formula) may be decreased after having breast augmentation, especially if the implants are placed above the muscle.  Many women worry about ruining their breast augmentation because they breast fed.  A recent study showed that the enlargement of the breasts during pregnancy has the biggest impact on sagging of the breasts than breast feeding.  So, make the decision on breastfeeding based on your preferences and specific situation.

The Ultra High implants have more projection then a High Profile implant i.e. Your breast will be perky and stick out more using Ultra High implants . An Ultra High 800cc implant has a projection i.e. Thickness of 6.7cm. An 800cc High profile implant has a projection of 6.0 cm .     A very important measurement is your base width diameter . This represents the width of your breast. The 800 cc High Profile implant is wider and flatter than the 800cc Ultra High profile implant .

11838835,question,,"Ms. Meghan, this is a question that we are asked frequently during our consultations. There is no 'correct' answer as each person has individual preferences and an overall comfort level for their body. That having been said, the ideal breast size is compatible with the general body structure of the person. From your photos, you are very fit but have a low starting volume. The issue is 'volume' and how to balance the shape and projection. As a general rule, it takes about 175-200 cc per cup size increase. So, a 300 cc implant would be expected to give you a one and a half cup increase. It may be that that is not enough. You have a diameter of 12 cm. So that fits with the Allergan 310, but have you tried other sizes? Such as the Mentor Mod Plus Xtra, which is also in the 12 cm range but with slightly more volume? The 325 cc has a diameter of 11.9 cm, while the 350 cc has a diameter of 12.3. I think you will benefit from the increased volume based on your starting point. But I also know that breast size is very personal. If you are still working on determining the size, I would ask you to try some of the newer sizes. 'Test drive' as many implants as you can. I believe that you will be very happy with whatever size you choose.

	Pregnancy affects each woman differently. 

	The following can all play a role:

	* Age
	* Genetics
	* Weight fluctuations
	* Luck

	We all can think of a Mom whose body bounced back quickly after pregnancy &ndash; this is often not the norm!

	Most women have PERMANENT CHANGES following pregnancy, including:

	* Stretch marks
	* Breast deflation, drooping
	* Excess abdominal skin and fat
	* Loss of abdominal muscle tone

	WHY a &ldquo;Mommy Makeover&rdquo;?

	How a mother feels about herself as a mother and a woman is integral to her self image and self esteem. For a mom to want to take care of herself and feel youthful, sexy and confident is NOT self-centered or vain!

	&ldquo;Mommy Makeover&rdquo; plastic surgery is a cosmetic procedure aimed at making a mother&rsquo;s breasts and body look the way before she had children&hellip; or perhaps even better than when she started!

	Procedures usually include some or a combination of the following:

	* Breasts - Lift, Augmentation or Reduction
	* Tummy - Tuck (Abdominoplasty), &ldquo;Mini&rdquo;-Abdominoplasty
	* Body - Liposuction

	Be sure to visit a Board-Certified Plastic Surgeon with extensive experience in these types of surgeries. Ask to see before-and-after pictures of typical results, and to speak to other patients to learn about their experience with the surgeon.

	Do your homework! Any surgery is a major event in your life, and affects your family as well as you.

	A &quot;mommy makeover&quot; can be a wonderful experience, as long as it is done for the right reasons, by the right surgeon, at the right time in your life.

	Hi,

	&nbsp;If your OB-GYN doctor feels that the combination procedures are safe for you, then it would be my recommendation that you do the combination procedure.&nbsp;

	&nbsp;Unless you are very large or need a breast reduction, then breast and body surgery can all be done at the same time.&nbsp; I do not feel that an extra hour or so on your breasts combined with the tummy tuck and lipo would cause much of a difficulty.&nbsp; I understand that it sounds risky but you need to compare this to multiple anesthesia risks.&nbsp; These too can be argued are very small.

	&nbsp; Case by case basis.&nbsp; If you are a smaller mom with a 1 1/2 hour tummy tuck and an hour breast surgery, why not.&nbsp; If you need more extensive body contouring and breast contouring, then perhaps break them up.&nbsp;

	&nbsp; There is no question as far as cost that a combined surgery will save a significant amount of money but this should not be the primary reason for combining.&nbsp;

	Dear Ms Delgado,

	To simply answer your question: yes you can have breast implants - even at age 16. People will tell you that you cannot have breast implants at age 16 because that is referring to cosmetic breast enlargement. You would be having treatment for a reconstructive problem. I was a children's plastic surgeon at a University in the past and I did breast implants for girls at age 16.

	This is what I would suggest you do: Have you mom read this note. Have her make you an appointment in the plastic surgery department at the University of Miami. They will help you and likely it will be covered under your health insurance. Now would be a great time to start.

2491816,question,,"Hello dear thanks for your important question.A tremendous amount of effort goes into a plastic surgery decision. Anticipation of the procedure can cause stress. Recovery is another issue, whether it includes the mixed emotion of grieving the facial or bodily imperfection loss, or the lack of support from a family member or friends. For example, your child may prefer that mom would look just the way she always was. In fact, the initial discomforting recovery appearance, such as bruising and swelling, may bring on the blues for quite a few weeks after surgery.Postoperative depression is not uncommon with any surgery. The symptoms of postoperative depression are similar to those associated with post-partum depression. After recovery, the emotional and social challenge associated with gazing eyes or disapproving looks from others can produce feelings of isolation or anger. At the same time, the final results may be very positive, in some cases a dramatic alteration.Managing Expectations:It is important to have realistic expectations. While the procedure may positively impact the perception of those around you, the increased attention or disappointment of those around you may be a new challenge to manage. Going into plastic surgery to improve a bodily or facial flaw is one thing; expectations to improve the rest of your life are another thing. While the results of plastic surgery may positively shape many aspects of your life, it's not the most appropriate reason to have surgery. The appropriate reason for cosmetic surgery is to improve the appearance of a specific area of your body.Good luck :)","Tania Medina de Garcia, MD answers: Why does some patients experience the blues or feel sad and down after the Tummy Tuck proc",/question/charlotte-nc-patients-experience-blues-feel-sad-after-tt-procedure

13657864,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding your concerns after your tummy tuck. Based on your description, it sounds like your initial procedure left you with uneven skin distribution, excessive tension in the lower pelvic area, and loose skin above your navel. These issues can often be addressed with a revision tummy tuck performed by a board-certified plastic surgeon who specializes in corrective procedures.During a revision, the surgeon can release the excessive tension in the lower pelvic area and redistribute the loose skin above the navel to achieve a more balanced appearance. This may involve revising your initial incision and extending it slightly to allow for better skin redraping. If the pubic area, or mons, was pulled too high during your first surgery, a procedure called monsplasty could be performed to reposition and reshape this area for a more natural contour. Additionally, if your abdominal muscles were not adequately repaired or if diastasis recti (muscle separation) was overlooked, the revision surgery may include muscle tightening to improve the overall contour of your midsection.While it is possible to make significant improvements with revision surgery, it is essential to set realistic expectations. The results will depend on the quality of your skin, the degree of correction needed, and the specifics of your previous procedure. I recommend consulting with a board-certified plastic surgeon who has extensive experience in tummy tuck revisions. Bring any documentation or photos from your first surgery to help the surgeon understand what was done initially and how best to correct the issues you are experiencing.This process will not only address the loose skin and high tension but will also aim to improve your comfort and overall satisfaction with the results.

9915203,question,,"First of all, you did nothing wrong! Pregnancy and breastfeeding can cause many changes to your breasts - your breast tissue is dynamic and changes over time. Implants are more static - in most cases, they stay put and don't move and migrate in their pocket. What happened is your breast tissue and breast skin enlarged and stretched during your pregnancy; if you breastfed, this also contributed.Now that your breast tissue is returning to its pre-pregnancy size, the stretched skin is now drooping and this produces the Snoopy or waterfall deformity you see, where the breast tissue and skin falls past the implants, which stay in place. Please go see your original surgeon and discuss your situation. You will need a breast lift (mastopexy) to reposition your breast tissue, elevate your nipples,and remove some of the redundant skin.

	This, unfortunately, is LIKELY to happen unless the area is specifically treated.

	Of course, each situation is different and it is nearly impossible to generalize with any accuracy for a specific patient.&nbsp; But if you&#39;re having skin and fat removed from some areas and not others, it&#39;s not surprising that if even a small amount of weight is put on later, it will go to the remaining &quot;pockets&quot; of fat.&nbsp; If the mons pubis (pubic area) was a little full before and/or was not treated during the surgery (removal of excess skin, fat or both; either with direct excision, liposuction or a combination) then it&#39;s not too surprising that it has become fuller after the surgery.

	The best approach is to speak to your PS and see if a small amount of lipo can be done now.&nbsp; It&#39;s not THAT big a procedure (easy for me to say!) and it may help the balance of the abdominal region.

	And if you&#39;ve put on a significant amount of weight since the surgery, then I would advise losing that weight, or as much of it as you can, before considering having additional surgery.

	Most of the time, skin grafts just require local anesthesia. However, in extreme cases, sometimes general anesthesia can be used. Here are your answers:

	1. General anesthesia is safe AS LONG AS he is very healthy! He will need to have an EKG before the procedure and be under careful view of the anesthesiologist. For patients who need a large or very in-depth skin graft sometimes it&#39;s nicer to be under anesthesia, especially if a patient (and bless them, but many elderly gentlemen get very irritated about how long things take!) if the patient is irritated or impatient.

	2. It&#39;s not really needed for any purpose other than making the procedure easier for the surgeon. There is no reason the anesthesia will make the procedure better or safer. I will also, although this might not be popular, say that some doctors perform surgeries under anesthesia because a lot more of the cost can be billed and paid by insurance that way. There&#39;s the anesthesia, the surgery room, the procedure itself, the post care, etc. You can take something that&#39;s a minor, easy, hour or so procedure and bill a lot more money and collect it! Having general anesthesia will require more pre-work for your father, as well he might not feel great and will have to wait at the surgery center for a bit after the procedure should he elect to do it under general anesthesia.

	In most cases, a tummy tuck does not alter the shape of the external genitalia. I have had a couple of women (mostly larger than you) who have had some upward pull. &nbsp;I believe this mainly resulted from an attempt to decrease the volume of the mons region and in doing so also pulled somewhat on the external labia.

	Hello Laritza, yes, it can be normal to have swelling in the pubic (mons) area after a tummy tuck. Most people get a lot of swelling after a tummy tuck, especially if liposuction is performed.&nbsp; With time, the swelling (which is basically fluid), settles to the lowest area, which is the pubic area. Also, sometimes the pubic area is liposuctioned or treated during the tummy tuck, which will make it even more swollen.

	The best ways to treat this is by wearing a compression garment for at least one month after surgery, massaging the area, and limiting your activity while you're healing. And of course, you should discuss this with your plastic surgeon. I hope this helps and wish you all the best!

11857229,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding what to do with your abdomen in regards to excess skin and fat of your central and lateral abdomen. My opinion would be to try to lose as much weight as you possibly can. If you cannot lose any more weight and your weight has plateaued then I would suggest a tummy tuck or abdominoplasty. During the abdominoplasty, the rectus abdominus or six-pack muscles are repaired and the mons is lifted and reduced. Typically, all of the skin and fat from your c-section scar to above the belly button would be removed from hip to hip. I would suggest an extended tummy tuck to go past your hips to take care of the love handles and excess skin and fat. At the conclusion of the procedure, I would also suggest lipo over the love handle region to remove even more fat. In conclusion, I would suggest a horizontal tummy tuck, muscle repair, pubic lift and reduction, and liposuction. I hope this helps to answer your question regarding what to do with your abdomen.

	The shape and contour of the mons (pubic hair area) should be addressed by your surgeon in your discussions before surgery and treated during surgery. It is not unusual to have some swelling in that area for weeks to months after surgery, if it persists for more that six months, it is likely due to residual fat and can often be treated with liposuction which should be done during the tummy tuck.&nbsp;

	It is not unusual for the pubic hair line to be pulled up after a tummy tuck, particularly in someone who does not have a lot of extra skin to pull down in the first place or in someone who naturally has a high umbilicus on the abdomen. In these circumstances, once again, you surgeon should warn you ahead of time that this may happen.&nbsp; After surgery, to correct this problem, laser hair removal can be used to lower the hair line as long as the hair is dark.&nbsp; In the event that, after all of the swelling has gone down and the skin has relaxed, you have some extra skin left below your belly button, some of the hair-bearing skin below your scar can be removed to lower the hair line.

	All patients are concerned with the cost of elective surgery. There are a number of factors that affect the cost of a body lift. First, will the body lift include a tummy tuck, or is it limited to buttocks and thighs. Second, the cost of the surgery center and hospitalization, if needed. The other factors include surgeons reputation and expertise, and other competitive factors.

	In my practice we charge 10-12 K for a body lift without a tummy tuck, and 18-22 K for a body lift with a tummy tuck. I do a number of body lifts on non-bariatric patients, namely moms that want to regain their pre-pregnancy looks, the cost of those procedures are less than for a massive weight loss patient. With significant experience, talent and a well rehearsed surgical team a surgeon can perform this type of surgery in about 4-5 hours for a full body lift and a tummy tuck. Most of our patients recover in a non-hospital recovery center, allowing for a significant cost savings without compromising any safety.

	Thank you for the question.

	Of all the breast surgery I perform, I find that the breast augmentation/lifting procedure can be the most challenging. On the one hand, we are increasing the breast &nbsp;size with breast implants; &nbsp;on the other hand, we are reducing the breast &ldquo;envelope&rdquo; in order to achieve a breast lift. These two &ldquo;forces&rdquo; must be balanced as perfectly as possible in order to achieve the desired results. Removing too much skin/ breast tissue is problematic; &nbsp;removing too little breast skin/tissue can also be problematic.

	To achieve &nbsp;a surgical result where the breast implant and breast tissue &ldquo;come together&rdquo; and behave like a single breast is one of my goals but can be difficult to achieve. &nbsp;Essentially, we are trying to create a breast implant/breast tissue interface that feels and behaves as naturally ( as a single unit) &nbsp;as possible. Generally speaking, making sure that the breast implant has some sub muscular and some sub glandular component ( dual plane) &nbsp;and tailoring the overlying skin/subcutaneous tissue/breast tissue as precisely as possible over the underlying breast implant is key.

	I would suggest that you communicate your concerns clearly with your plastic surgeon; &nbsp;hopefully you have done your due diligence and have selected a plastic surgeon who can demonstrate significant experience achieving the results you are looking for.

	Swelling of the pubic area can last several months after having an abdominoplasty. &nbsp;However, sometimes the pubic region can appear bigger relative to the abdomen after a tummy tuck because all the excess skin above it was removed and now you can see the pubic area better than before. &nbsp;That is why many surgeon will choose to do some liposuction or lift the pubic area as part of or in addition to the tummy tuck. &nbsp;If this wasn&#39;t done, it can give the appearance of a permanently swollen mons pubis when actually it is the same size as it was before but it wasn&#39;t as obvious because your abdomen used to cover it up. &nbsp;Your plastic surgeon should be able to tell you what exactly was done in surgery and if this is something that is likely to subside with time or not.

200542,question,,"The late Dr. Ted Lockwood of Kansas City was an Anatomist ans a surgical visionary who single handedly revolutionized Tummy Tuck surgery and weight loss restoration surgery. He made many contributions to our profession and myself and many others regard him in extreme high esteem.

Among his innovations, besides describing the SFS layer which can readily pull the thighs up, he introduced the Lockwood dissector, a tool intended to allow skin undermining without dividing most of the blood vessels to the skin.

In his operation, which I perform very commonly, the transverse groin scar is NOT shorter but the tummy tuck is done with an aggressive plication (putting together) of the tummy muscles and careful undermining of the sides to preserve the blood flow to the sides of the upper tummy skin. The operation flattens the tummy, narrows the waist, lifts the thighs and a sagging Mons pubis.

10923629,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding whether you need a body lift or an extended tummy tuck. Based on your history of two kids and 50-pound weight loss, I would highly suggest a 360 circumferential lower body lift. Based on your pictures, especially the second picture, where you show a picture of the buttocks, you have excess skin and fat above the buttock crease. Based on your weight loss history and your pictures, I would highly suggest a 360 circumferential lower body lift. This would permanently remove excess skin and fat from the lower abdomen, upper abdomen, mons region, lateral hips and upper buttock region. This will permanently remove back, flank and saddle-bag fat far better than liposuction. In addition, you will get a much better shape than with just liposuction. Therefore, my opinion is to go with the lower body lift, rather than the extended tummy tuck. I hope that I have answered your questions whether you should have a 360 circumferential lower body lift or extended tummy tuck.  I specialize in reconstructive plastic surgery after weight loss.  If you have any more questions regarding the lower body lift, 360 circumferential lower body lift, belt lipectomy, belt abdominoplasty, or belt dermolipectomy please contact my office.

7060363,question,,The tummy tuck operation is successful because it removes the skin that is excess and may have stiaeinferior to the bellybutton.  The elements of the operation that are essential include elevating the skin up to the level of the bellybutton and then surgically incising around the bellybutton and releasing it from the overlying skin and leaving it attached to the abdominal wall.  Advancing the skin inferiorly down to the mons pubis and removing the excess skin allows for the flat and sculpted abdomen appearance.  The bellybutton needs to be delivered through the abdominal flap that is advanced inferiorly to allow the normal appearance and location of the bellybutton.  This involves a small incision in the flap that is advanced inferiorly.  The bellybutton is inset with sutures and frequently tacking sutures down to the abdominal wall to create the indented and aesthetic contours of an aestheticabdominal wall and shapely figure.  The sutures are frequently observable although sometimes they may be nylon sutures which need to be removed in the office in approximately 1 week after surgery.  Should your recovery be going any differently than this it is a good idea to follow up with your plastic surgeon for answers to any questions that you may have about your own personal course of medical recovery.,"R.

13281460,question,,"Hello generous262,019,Thank you for your inquiry about the persistent swelling six months after undergoing an extended tummy tuck, liposuction, muscle repair, and mons lift. Based on your history and photos, it is indeed unusual to experience significant swelling at this stage in your recovery. The presence of loose skin in your upper abdomen, as you described, indicates that this may not be swelling but rather excess skin that needs to be addressed.To effectively manage this issue, there are a few surgical options:Reverse Tummy Tuck: This procedure would involve removing excess skin from the upper abdomen, helping to achieve a tighter appearance.Revision Tummy Tuck: This approach could further tighten any loose skin and refine the results of your initial surgery.Vertical Incision: Although less commonly recommended due to the visibility of the resulting scar, a vertical incision from the sternum to the belly button could be a way to remove excess upper abdominal skin.Liposuction might not be advisable as it could potentially exacerbate the loose skin issue. It's important to thoroughly discuss these options with your plastic surgeon to determine the best course of action based on your specific needs and aesthetic goals.Remember, post-surgical changes can vary greatly among individuals, and your surgeon will have the best insight into your unique case.Wishing you the best in achieving your desired results.Sincerely,","J.

13405328,question,,"Hello Mrs. Williams, thank you for your question regarding the cost of liposuction on the sides and back. Its great to hear that your mom had positive results from her procedure, and its understandable that youd be interested in exploring this option for yourself.The cost of liposuction can vary widely depending on several factors:Geographic Location: Costs for cosmetic surgery can vary significantly depending on where the procedure is performed. Urban areas and regions with a higher cost of living generally have higher fees for plastic surgery.Surgeons Expertise: The experience and reputation of the surgeon can also influence the cost. Board-certified plastic surgeons with a well-established practice often charge more, but they also bring a higher level of expertise and safety to the procedure.Extent of the Procedure: The cost will also depend on how much fat you are looking to have removed and the number of areas being treated. Liposuction on the sides and back can be extensive, depending on the amount of fat and the surface area to be covered.Facility Fees: These fees cover the use of the surgery center or hospital where your liposuction is performed and can vary based on the location and the type of anesthesia used.Anesthesia Fees: The cost for anesthesia is typically separate from the surgeons fee and can depend on the length of the procedure.Additional Costs: These may include post-surgery garments, medications, and follow-up visits.On average, liposuction costs can range from $2,000 to $8,000 per treatment area, but this can be higher or lower based on the above factors. For a more specific estimate, its best to schedule consultations with a few board-certified plastic surgeons. They can provide a detailed assessment based on your body type and desired outcomes and give you an accurate cost estimate.Its also important to ensure that any decision about cosmetic surgery, especially at a young age, is carefully considered and discussed with a healthcare provider to ensure it is the right choice for your health and circumstances.I hope this information helps you start your journey toward deciding if liposuction is right for you, and I wish you the best of luck.Sincerely,J.

13487997,question,,"Hello Mom_of_Two, thank you for your question regarding lower back pain improvement after a tummy tuck.It's encouraging to hear that you're scheduled for a full tummy tuck, which will address your fascia, belly button hernia, and excess skin removal. Given your description of having paper-thin fascia and a significant lack of core muscle strength, it's understandable that you're experiencing lower back pain. When the core muscles are weakened or separated, as is often the case after multiple pregnancies or significant weight changes, the body loses a key support structure for the spine, leading to compensatory strain and pain in the lower back.A tummy tuck, particularly one that includes muscle repair, can significantly improve the function and strength of your core. By bringing the separated rectus muscles back together, the surgery essentially reconstructs your abdominal wall, providing better support for your spine and improving overall posture. Many patients report a notable reduction in back pain following a tummy tuck, as the surgery helps restore the balance and alignment of the body's core muscles.However, it's important to have realistic expectations. While many patients experience relief from back pain post-tummy tuck, individual results can vary. The degree of improvement in back pain can depend on several factors, including the severity of the muscle separation, the extent of the surgery, and your body's healing process. Additionally, while the surgery can restore your core structure, ongoing physical therapy and core-strengthening exercises will be crucial in maintaining and enhancing the results.Your physical therapist's skepticism is not uncommon, as medical professionals often advise caution and set realistic expectations. It's important to understand that while the surgery can provide structural improvements, it may not completely eliminate back pain, especially if other factors are contributing to it.In conclusion, based on your severe case and the nature of your surgery, there is a good chance that your lower back pain will improve as your core strength is restored. However, continue to work closely with your physical therapist and follow any post-operative guidelines from your plastic surgeon to maximize your recovery and results.Good luck with your surgery, and I hope this helps to provide some clarity and optimism regarding your lower back pain.Sincerely,J.

326061,question,,"To understand what transconjunctival means, let's ask why do we get under-eye bags in the first place? Well, baggy eyelid people have mom or dad to blame. It's caused by fatty deposits behind the eyelids that bulge forward and even young people have under-eye bags because mom or dad probably had them, too. As we celebrate more birthdays, we can develop even more eyelid bulging and wrinkles that even Botox can't smooth - look at Bill Clinton's eyes before and after skillful de-bagging!. But for young and mature alike, there still is hope! If bags are the only issue, then we can get to those pesky fatty deposits by pulling the eyelid forward and accessing them from the inside. If you've ever flipped your upper lids inside-out, then you know what the conjunctiva looks like - smooth and shiny, the conj lubricates the eyeball. Same thing on the inside of the lower lids. Trans means going through, or across, hence the mouthful that surgeons use to describe this approach means going through the shiny inside lining of the eyelid. And, that's why it's scarless, because the scar is totally hidden (unless you walk around with your lids flipped out). Avoiding having a visible scar is the reason we use this approach. A picture is worth a thousand words - look at the eyelid surgery patient in my gallery - she was treated by this method. All in all, it's a very safe way to finally check those bags at the door and give your eyes a rested, youthful appearance. BUT, be sure that you are in the hands of a board-certified plastic surgeon who does a lot of aesthetic eyelid surgery. This is a must!","Ariel N.

	There are many factors that go in to a decision about reconstruction after Mohs surgery or excision of a skin cancer on the nose.&nbsp; The convex areas such as the nasl tip or the convex surface of the nostril in those patients whose nostrils are very rounded, do not typically heal well with just dressing changes.&nbsp; The concave areas of the crease around the nostril heal somewhat better, or the area between the nasal bridge and the eye in its concavity.&nbsp; If a patient&#39;s skin is very thick and has oily porous skin, the second intent healing may leave too shiny and thin a scar to match.&nbsp; Skin grafts are not a perfect match, either, however.&nbsp; In fact, over a year, the graft becomes thinner and yellow or even brown on rare occasions whereas others become white.&nbsp; Some wounds that are left to heal on their own contract and leave a disfigured appearance of a close-by cosmetic area if it is pulled from the conraction.&nbsp; For these reasons, a flap is often done, in which the neighboring skin maintains its blood flow and texture and color but creates a larger scar than second intent healing or a graft. Reconstruction possibilities are numerous and require a physician to think of your anatomy, skin characteristics, neighboring regions with their &quot;free margins&quot; that can get pulled because they have nothing anchoring them, etc. Science and art is involved in this decision making process, mixed with experience.

I agree with your PCP that your body is stable, and further weight loss would be unlikely. Regarding your areas of concern and the attached pictures, I suggest an extended abdominoplasty, brachioplasty, and partial vertical torsoplasty. During your abdominoplasty or tummy tuck, the excess skin and fat of the abdomen would be removed. The excess would be from just above the pubic region to the umbilicus. I suggest an extended tummy tuck because you have excess skin and fat over the hips. That means the incision would extend to the outer hip. During your tummy tuck, I would suggest a mons lift and reduction, muscle plication from the umbilicus to the sternum, and recreation of your belly button. During your arm reduction or brachioplasty, I suggest including arm liposuction and an incision from the armpit to the elbow regarding the axillary region. I suggest a vertical torsoplasty with an incision from your armpit down the side of your chest just to where the breast fold starts. If the fold underneath the bra strap also bothers you, the incision can be extended down to where your hourglass figure dips inward. These procedures can be combined. These procedures can be performed under general anesthesia with the guidance of an anesthesiologist. These procedures are performed on an outpatient basis. The abdominoplasty would take about 3-5 hours, depending on the speed of your plastic surgeon. The arm reduction should take approximately 3-4 hours, and the vertical torsoplasty 1-2 hours.

8587185,question,,"Patients often think in terms of cup size when considering augmentation. Unfortunately, devices are sized in terms of milliliters (cc) of volume. This can lead to some confusion when sizing. Additionally, it is important to remember that cup size itself is not standardized with variations from one manufacturer to another. Unfortunately, as many women can attest their cup size in an industry leader such as VS is not necessarily transferable to another brand.Another point which is often under appreciated is that of anatomy and starting point. Any implant will add volume to the volume which is already present. The implant is additive. A particular volume willnot necessarily confer the same cup size to different patients (often times it will not even confer the same cup size to different breasts in the same individual...remember they are sisters not twins).A general rule of thumb is that 125cc can represent somewhere between 1/2 to a full cup size increase. Smaller volume differentials (25-50cc) are typically less consequential representing a volumechange of less than a shot glass. However, I have found these numbers, at least anecdotally, to be of little help. Patients often present with notions/goals which do not correlate with these sorts of sterile volumetric assessments.When sizing patients, there are a number of useful tools including:-3D imaging (has the added benefit of offering a volumetric analysis of the pre-operative breast)-Breast sizers (rice bags)-Goal photosI also recommend that patients commit to a particular look rather than a cup size. Once a patient settles on a look that pleases them the overall cup size increase becomes less relevant.The key to obtaining a natural result is to stay within the parameters defined by your BWD.With regards to your specific question, the best advice is to love the look...not the cup. If you are happy with the look of 550 cc, you have your answer.

1284811,question,,"Any surgery, whether abdominoplasty, appendectomy, or rhinoplasty, is likely to produce some numbness near the incision, because the small nerves (too small to see) are cut. &nbsp;Abdominoplasty, in particular, generally requires elevation of a skin flap from the abdominal musculature, and must inevitably cut some of the small sensory nerves, so some numbness will always occur, even if it is not noticed.Near the edges of the elevated area, some nerves will be traveling under the skin, and so numbness will be less, even though the underlying tissue was elevated. &nbsp;As time goes by after surgery, the nerves tend to grow back -- this can be both from the cut ends of the nerves, as well as from nerves to the neighboring skin. &nbsp;Often, as the nerves grow back, a tingling sensation may be felt. &nbsp;This sensation is generally more noticeable than the numbness itself.You mention that you were concerned that the numbness was developing, and that that might represent some complication. &nbsp;You can be assured that there is no complication of abdominoplasty where the primary indication is an enlarging area of numbness. &nbsp;Your PS is correct: the numbness from the belly button to the mons pubis is not only normal, it is expected.","James Nachbar, MD answers: Is it common to have full sensation and then go completely numb two weeks after Tummy Tuck?",/question/numbness-started-two-weeks-post-op-after-tummy-tuck

	For offices that require a blood test, the required test is a CBC (complete blood count).

	A complete blood count (CBC) test measures the following:
	The number of red blood cells (RBCs)
	The number of white blood cells (WBCs)
	The total amount of hemoglobin in the blood
	The fraction of the blood composed of red blood cells (hematocrit)

	The CBC test also provides information about the following measurements:
	Average red blood cell size (MCV)
	Hemoglobin amount per red blood cell (MCH)
	The amount of hemoglobin relative to the size of the cell (hemoglobin concentration) per red blood cell (MCHC)

	The platelet count is also usually included in the CBC.

	Offices generally do not charge to draw the blood, but lab fees from an independent facility are usually separate.

	The blood test should be done within 30 days of surgery.

9029019,question,,"Thank you for this excellent question. The more tummy tucks a surgeon does, in general, the neater the scars are. However, there is not a single plastic surgeon around who does tummy tucks who hasn't had an uneven scar. Sometimes it's the surgeon, sometimes it's the patient's anatomy. For instance, uneven excess loose skin on the anterior thighs can often make the ultimate scar asymmetric because as you pull the abdomen down, you pull the anterior thigh up. In my practice, I try to have the scar 2 finger breadths above the vagina, across the pelvic area, and then follow the crease between the abdomen and thigh. I intentionally put tension between the mons pubis area and the abdominal flap to pull the vulva upward, decreasing or eliminating the stress incontinence. To accomplish this, I flex the surgical table to 30 degrees to create this tension. It is my belief, along with many other plastic surgeons, that the scar should be low and thin. A beautiful scar above the bikini or panty line is still a scar. The scar your plastic surgeon creates often can make or break the surgery. However, a well hidden scar trumps a beautiful scar any day.","S. Larry Schlesinger, MD, FACS answers: Why are some tummy tuck lines so straight while others are like a zig-zag or not even?

9674856,question,,"Hello and thank you for your question. Depending on how loose your abdominal skin is determines how much skin will be able to be removed. It can be skin from your pubic area to above your umbilicus is able to be safely excised, while sometimes it is only skin beneath the umbilicus. This depends on your anatomy and your skin. Iwould expect most of the stretch marks beneath your umbilicus to be cut away with an abdominoplasty, as this is the case for most women seeking the surgery. THe stretch marks in your groin would likely change. If they are on your mons pubis - the area that a bikini normally hides, they may be pulled upward for a tighter contour or cut away at the top. If they are in your bikini line or upper thighs Iwould expect a modest amount of pull upwards towards the abdomen but not a significant amount. It really depends on where these stretch marks are. If the stretch marks on your flanks are on the sides of your body, the abdominoplasty scar could be elongated to be able to cut away this stretched skin as well. If they are on the back of your body, you would need to have what is called a belt lipectomy or truncal body lift to cut these away and lift your buttocks if that is a priority for you.In nearly all cases, stretch marks are improved by skin tightening and skin removal surgery. You can likely mimic this by pulling the skin on your lower abdomen and visualizing what happens to the stretch marks. This is similar to what they will look like afterward.Ihope that helps.

	Dear Military Mom:

	(Video and Link provided by clicking &quot;more&quot; below.) Every persons recovery is different, this is why there are follow-up appointments. The best person to ask this question is the plastic surgeon who did the repair. That being said, most of my patients have all restrictions lifted at six weeks after surgery.

	This number comes not from tummy tuck repairs but studies done after hernia repair. Hernia repairs use the same tissue; however, if there was a hernia, there was a bigger problem than that treated with a tummy tuck. The studies show hernias are more likely to recur if manual labor is restarted sooner than six weeks after the hernia repair.

	In general, 6 weeks after a tummy tuck, sit-ups should be safe, but do check with your plastic surgeon. The strength of your repair may influence the advice.

2612624,question,,"Hi Top67,Thanks for the question and the photographs. They certainly help with your question. It would be possible to remove the majority of the fat in that area, but remember that some fat must be left behind for contouring and to allow the tissue(skin) to glide on the muscle/bone in that region. I think however, that it would give you a result that you would be unhappy with as it would result in excess skin despite that the fat would be gone. It would however increase the show of the remaining body parts which could be considered a bonus.A surgery to remove the extra skin could be done alone or in conjunction with an abdominalplasty or alone. Cost would certainly vary. I know that the cost would go up if you decided to do a removal of the skin with the liposuction of the mons area. It usually runs about 2-5k for lipo and a monsplasty plus anesthesia and facility fees here in the phoenix area. Remember that it should be about your expectations and not cost. Pick a surgeon who you feel comfortable with and that seems fair in what they are promising and cost.

9233903,question,,"Hi, thank you for your question regarding does a360 circumferential lower body lift orbelt lipectomy also lift the thighs. The answer is yes and no. During a360 circumferential lower body lift, excess lower abdominal, outer thigh, and upper buttock skin and fat are removed. Afterthis excess skin and fat is removed, the tissues are carefully re-approximated. During this re-approximationof tissue, the abdomen is pulled down andthe outer thighs and buttocksare lifted. By removing and putting back togetherthis centralized area of excess lower torsoskinand fat, theresult is a tight, flat abdomen with alifted and ideally,shapelyouter thighs and buttocks. Therefore, the360 circumferential lower body lift only truly elevates the lateral orouter thighs, not the inner thighs. During a tummy tuck or abdominoplasty, excess abdominal skin and fat are removed, therectus abdominis muscles are tightened, andthe pubic region (mons or FUPA) israised and reduced. As the name implies, a tummy tuck onlyaddresses the tummy, not the thighs. However, a thigh lift would correct the thighs. During athigh lift, thigh liposuction is performed, the innerthigh is opened, and an elliptical area ofexcess thigh skinand fat isremoved. Then,the innerthigh is re-approximated. Usually, a medial or inner thigh lift can be performed at the same time as as a360 circumferential lower body lift or tummy tuck.

13228611,question,,"Hi Metal mom30,Thank you for reaching out with your question about the choice between saline and textured silicone breast implants, especially given your specific situation as a 43-year-old mother. I appreciate the details you've provided about your background.First and foremost, it's essential to note that textured breast implants are no longer recommended or widely used due to their association with a specific type of cancer risk. As a result, they are not manufactured anymore, and I strongly advise against using them. Consequently, the plastic surgery community, including myself, has shifted away from these implants.When deciding between saline and silicone implants, it ultimately comes down to a combined decision between you and your plastic surgeon. However, most plastic surgeons, including myself, lean towards silicone implants for several reasons. Silicone implants tend to offer a more natural feel and appearance, and statistically, they are associated with a lower rate of capsular contracture compared to their saline counterparts.Regarding the risk of sagging, it's important to understand that this risk is more closely related to the quality of your breast tissue and skin laxity rather than the type of implant used. Whether you choose silicone or saline implants, if there's a significant risk of sagging, it should be addressed during the surgery, potentially with a mastopexy (breast lift) procedure.In summary, while textured breast implants are not a viable option, choosing between saline and silicone should be based on your preferences and the expert guidance of an experienced, board-certified plastic surgeon. They can guide you on the best approach to achieve your desired aesthetic outcome. I hope this provides clarity for your decision-making process, and I wish you the best in your journey.Sincerely,J.

12239855,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding how to lift the body, arm, back, breast, basically everything! First, congratulations on your weight loss. Great accomplishment!  Second, though it would be fantastic if your skin snaps back and shrink wraps around your new body, it is highly unlikely that after 145 pound weight loss that the skin will do so. Unfortunately, your skin has been stretched and it is unlikely to bounce back.  Therefore, I would suggest several staged surgeries to reconstruct your entire body. For your abdomen, I would suggest either an extended tummy tuck or a fleur-de-lis abdominoplasty.  These procedures will permanently eliminate excess skinned fat of the abdomen, raise the pubic or mons region, re-create the belly button, and suture the weakened abdominal wall muscles. For your arms, I would suggest an arm lift, arm reduction, or brachioplasty. During your brachioplasty, arm liposuction is performed and an incision is made from the armpit to the elbow. For your back fat and skin rolls, I would suggest either a horizontal or vertical torsoplasty. Your best results will be obtained with the horizontal torsoplasty. During  a horizontal torsoplasty, an incision is made across your back and excess skin and fat is removed.  For your breast, if you desire a larger breast size, I would suggest breast implants. If you do not desire breast implants, then I would just suggest an anchor breast lift (mastopexy). If you decide on breast implants, you will need a breast lift. The excess skin and fat on the side of the breast can be incorporated with the above mentioned horizontal torsoplasty.Many of these plastic surgery procedures can be combined. In your case, I would perform the horizontal torsoplasty and the extended tummy tuck during the first surgery. Then, 1 to 2 months later, I would do the arms (brachioplasty) and breast lift (mastopexy) with or without breast augmentation.  I hope these answers help.  ","J.

8010479,question,,"Excellent question. The decision between a mini-tummy tuck and a traditional tummy tuck is very dependent on the patient's goals and specific anatomy. Generally speaking, patients with loose skin that extends above the belly-button or patients with widely separated stomach muscles need a traditional tummy tuck. Most moms are usually better candidates for a traditional tummy tuck due to the stretched out skin and muscles from pregnancies that extends above the belly button. If a patient has loose skin and separated muscles&nbsp;above the belly button and gets a mini-tummy tuck, sometimes the abdomen can then look tight and flat below the belly button but loose and floppy above - kinda wierd. I have fixed a few of these patients before where the previous surgeon probably picked the wrong surgery. Also, a full tummy tuck allows removing all the stretch marks below the belly button. The difference in scar length is minimal, and if the scar is placed low, it is hidden and really as non-issue.So, I can't say for sure which is better for you. But these are the thoughts that go through my head when I help&nbsp;make the decision with the patient.

Thank you for your history and your pictures. Congratulations on your weight loss! What a great accomplishment! If you've lost 100 pounds and you have loose stomach skin, the best surgery for you would either be a tummy tuck or a 360 circumferential lower body lift. Other surgeries like liposuction will only remove fat and leave the stomach skin even looser. Unfortunately, with your weight loss, your skin is not likely to snap back with only liposuction. Therefore, most plastic surgeons would agree that in a patient with a 100-pound weight loss with loose stomach skin, you would do best with a horizontal abdominoplasty or tummy tuck. During a tummy tuck, an incision is made low in the pubic region and then extends over the hips. Tissue dissection is done up to your sternum, and the rectus abdominis muscle is exposed. The rectus muscle is plicated because you have lost weight and the fascia is weak. Then, the excess skin and fat from the top of the pubic region to just above the belly button is removed. The skin that is at the level of your belly button is pulled down to the pubic region. The mons pubis can also be reduced during the tummy tuck. A tummy tuck takes approximately 3 to 4 hours to complete under general anesthesia. Plan on a 2 to 3-week recovery. Drains will need to stay in place for approximately 10 to 14 days.

11752818,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding how to improve your breast and abdomen with a mommy makeover. A mommy makeover will significantly improve your breast and abdomen. First, I would concentrate on weight loss. Further weight loss will improve the results of your tummy tuck and abdominoplasty. Further weight loss should ideally reduce more visceral fat or inner abdominal fat. This will make your tummy stick out less. Once you have lost more weight and your weight has been stable for 3 to 4 months then I would suggest a mommy makeover. Your mommy makeover will consist of an abdominoplasty or tummy tuck, breast lift or mastopexy, and breast augmentation. Lets focus on what your tummy tuck during a mommy makeover would entail. This would entail elimination of excess skin and fat of the lower abdomen, re-creation of the belly button, mons or pubic or FUPA region, and rectus abdominis muscle plication. During the breast portion for your mommy makeover, I would suggest breast augmentation. I would suggest augmentation with breast FDA approved breast implants. The size of the breast implants will be determined by what breast size you want to become. This is done through extensive time with you in the office sizing and viewing the different size implants. Based on the size implants you choose, as well as the shape of the breast you desire, these factors will determine the type of breast lift that will be required. I would anticipate you either need a lollipop or an anchor breast lift or mastopexy. During a lollipop and anchor mastopexy, an incision is made around the areola and down the front of the breast. With an anchor mastopexy, the incision is extended underneath the breast to ask achieve a fuller lift. I hope this helps explain your optimal results. So in conclusion, lose weight, maintain your weight, and then seek a mommy makeover with a tummy tuck, breast lift, and breast augmentation.

Real buttocks lift should be included in the LBL, some liposuction to waist and lovehandles and use that small amount to transfer to buttocks. 6 months later the upper body lift can be done safely which means breast lift and augmentation using implants (if you want), arm lift and lateral torsoplasty. BBL wont improve or  lift buttocks and either thighs. You have already a nice bone frame, so I can only foresee a wonderful result. My recommendation is to have consultation only with a Board Certified PS and expert in After weight loss surgery. Be encouraged! Dr. Crdenas ","Carmina Cardenas, MD answers: Surgeries required?

You have excess of the width of your abdominal  skin and have those attachments on the sides of the belly button which make the saggy skin more obvious. So you will be a great candidate to convert your TT into a Fleur de Lis-Lower body lift, which means to do the vertical incision in the midline to remove the excess of width, thake advantage and do a tight muscle repair to create a flatter abdomen and smaller waist and have some shape. The circumferential incision will be to perform the buttocks lift and I would add some liposuction to the back and waist  to add curves and transfer a bit of fat to buttocks. Your mons would be revised during the procedure. Your breast is beyond third degree saggy and will need a major breast lift-reconstruction, possibly augmentation, plus you will be candidate also for lateral torsoplasty, back lift to achieve a smooth and feminine back and possibly an arm lift.

You have developed a significant excess of skin on your abdomen in both vectors: width and length, so just removing one vector and perform a solo Fleur de Lis (vertical) or the 360 incision (horizontal) wont be enough to achieve a great result: nice, tight and rejuvenated abdomen. So you are candidate for the combination of procedures: Lower body lift-Fleur de Lis or at least an Extended Tummy Tuck- Fleur de Lis with muscle repair, most likely mons lift, buttocks lift (if 360 option), and just a bit of liposuction to lovehandles. Regarding your chest you have the combination of features: excess of skin, excess of breast tissue, and very large areolas, very low inframammary fold. So you will need a chest reconstruction with the goal of masculinization: skin removal, gland removal, reduction of areolas, reposition of areolas more lateral and closer to the new inframammary fold and lift the inframammary fold to a more masculine position. The combination of these procedures represents a long surgery, so on my opinion separated stages from the Body Lift. Be encouraged!! At the end you will be looking awesome.

The number of plastic surgeons to truly mastered these procedures are in a small minority.Likewise, not everybody seeking a BBL procedure is a good candidate for the operation.To make an assessment regarding the outcome of a plastic surgery procedure we generally always need to see a complete set of proper before and after pictures. If you dont have proper before, and after pictures and ask your surgeon to forward the pictures they took.In the hands of a sufficiently talented provider, patient should receive an assessment during an in person consultation, making it clear exactly what type of results they are likely to get. And Experian provider should have no difficulty showing you the before and after pictures of enough patients with similar body characteristics to your own to make it clear what your results are likely to look like.Recognize that early fat transfer results can look very impressive. Represent final long-term results. When reviewing before, and after pictures, always confirm the timeframe of when were taken in a relationship to the procedure. After pictures should never be taken less than 3 to 6 months from the date of surgery in order to be representative.Never assume that after pictures represent long-term outcomes. Always confirm the timeframe of when after pictures were taken.Most plastic surgeons in the United States, do not offer gluteal implant augmentation.Theres a good reason to my moms plastic surgeons dont perform procedure.Gluteal impaired augmentation, has a very high complication rate and even higher undesirable side effects, and overall low long term patient satisfaction. Patients considering getting gluteal implants should have a clear understanding of what they are signing up for, including all the complications and drawbacks that go with having his procedure.To minimize complications, undesirable side effects, and surgery failure patients, considering this procedure, should seek out one of the few plastic surgeons who focus their careers exclusively on this type of surgery.Best,Mats Hagstrom, MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD (license on probation) answers: BBL or implants after the first BBL?",/question/bear-de-bbl-implants-after-bbl

You need to know that liposuction or for that matter re injecting fat is not the most technically challenging procedure for a surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. Search for a surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery with years of experience in liposuction and fat transfers. Look at unbiased reviews. Look at many before and after photos of the surgeon who will be doing your procedure. How about the center, clinic or facility? Are they accredited by a national organization or do they just have State approval. Understand that at the current time, there are three nationally recognized organizations responsible for the highest levels of patient safety, AAAASF, AAACH and JCHO. You owe it to yourself to position yourself for the best possible results but under the most stringent safety regulations.How about anesthesia?

8010499,question,,"Great question.&nbsp;Usually, patients with loose skin or widely separated muscles&nbsp;that extend&nbsp;above the belly-button need a traditional tummy tuck. Most moms are usually better candidates for a traditional tummy tuck due to the stretched out skin and muscles from pregnancies that extends above the belly button. But, each case is unique. If a patient has loose skin and separated muscles&nbsp;above the belly button and gets a mini-tummy tuck, sometimes the abdomen can then look tight and flat below the belly button but loose and floppy above - kinda weird. I have fixed a few of these patients before where the previous surgeon probably picked the wrong surgery. Also, a full tummy tuck allows removing all the stretch marks below the belly button. The difference in scar length is minimal, and if the scar is placed low, it is hidden and really a&nbsp;non-issue.So, I can't say for sure which is better for you.

Yes, you can have liposuction of the Mons Pubis after a tummy tuck if you meet all the other health requirements for surgery.I often thin out areas of fat, such as the flanks (love handles) and pubic area before the actual tummy tuck portion to be able to pull and contour the waist into a more hour glass shape and make sure that a puffy pubic area is avoided after the tummy is completely healed and nice and tight so is the pubic area making for a fantastic result. I do find that the pubic region can take several months for the swelling and bruising to go away.You will get the best answer to your question by scheduling an in person consultation with a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and discuss your unique situation and concerns.

12850077,question,,"You havent done so already I suggest you schedule multiple in person consultations with local board-certified plastic surgeons. During the consultation, you can get an assessment in regards to your candidacy for various procedures, and a better understanding of what procedures can be done as a combined operation. There are advantages and disadvantages to having multiple procedures done at the same time. Having too many surgeries done at the same time, increases the risk and can cause surgeons to be tempted to cut corners in order to finish the procedure in a reasonable amount of time. Quality plastic surgery simply takes time and there is an appropriate amount of surgery that should be done as a single operation. The amount of surgery surgeon feels comfortable doing varies significantly between providers and to some degree depending on each patients candidacy for each of the procedures. Some plastic surgeons will address the mons pubis as part of a tummy tuck, and some may bill it as a separate procedure. I suggest having multiple in person, consultations with local, board-certified plastic surgeons in your community. During each consultation, ask each provider to open up their portfolio and show you their entire collection of previous patient who had similar body characteristics to your own for each of the procedures you are contemplating. an experience plastic surgeon should have no difficulty showing you the before and after pictures of at least 50 previous patients. Tummy tuck and breast surgery is often done as a combined procedure and is generally considered quite appropriate by most plastic surgeons. When having an extended tummy tuck, you should make it very clear during the consultation. Exactly how far the surgeon is going to take the incision and specifically if they plan on turning you during the operation. Theres only so far a surgeon can remove skin on the backside with patient laying on their back. To do an appropriate extended tummy tuck generally requires turning the patient and this is labor-intensive, and a fairly complex maneuver during surgery.. Why patients are unaware of being turned during surgery under general anesthesia? It is important to know if that is a plant part of the procedure because it determines how far the extended tummy tuck can be taken.You should have a clear understanding of what is meant by an extended tummy tuck by each of the providers and be shown proper before, and after pictures of extended versus regular tummy tucks so you have a very clear understanding of what an extended tummy tuck means in the hands of each provider.Continue having consultations until you feel comfortable.

12398053,question,,"Hello NadineMCX, Thank you for your question regarding advice sorting out your body after losing eight stone postop gastric sleeve surgery. Congratulations on your weight loss!  Great job.  The most important thing for you now is to continue losing weight. It makes no sense embarking upon reconstructive plastic surgery after massive weight loss at this point. If one or to do reconstructive plastic surgery after mass of weight loss at this time, post-operatively you may continue to lose more weight and thus, damage and destroy your plastic surgery results. This post plastic surgery weight loss may require either partial or total revision of plastic surgery already performed. In terms of the procedures you will need, you will probably need a 360 circumferential lower body lift. The 360 circumferential lower body lift is also called an extended tummy tuck and butt lift, belt lipectomy, or belt abdominoplasty  The 360 circumferential lower body lift procedure includes abdominoplasty (tummy tuck), pubic (mons) lift or reduction, hip lift/reduction, and butt lift/reduction.  You did not provide pictures of your breast. However, I would anticipate you would need a breast reduction, based on your complaints. I would anticipate you would need a full anchor mastopexy and breast reduction. That means the incision goes around the areola, down the front of the breast, and underneath each breast. On average, the 360 circumferential lower body lift takes approximately six to eight hours to complete under general anesthesia. Typically, your breast reduction would take 4 to 5 hours.  In regards to price, this varies widely by geographic location. I would suggest you consult with several board Certified plastic surgeons to get the price range. You may also consider traveling internationally to find a body lift expert. I specialize in reconstructive plastic surgery after weight loss.  If you have any more questions regarding the lower body lift, 360 circumferential lower body lift, belt lipectomy, belt abdominoplasty, or belt dermolipectomy please contact my office. Since the body lift is a big procedure, please seek an experienced, board certified plastic surgeonwith significant experience performing the lower body lift. Do your research.  Make sure they have performed at least 100 circumferential lower body lift surgeries and have the before and after pictures to prove it.

Themoderate plus is the most commonly usedprofile in my practice. Itallowsfor the most reasonable volume in a given BWD. In my practice, low profile implants are the least commonly used (widest and flattest).I will typically reserve high profile devices for smaller framed individuals or those seeking a less subtle more dramatic change (the opposite of natural).In general, the difference between a highand Mod (+), in reality, is very small (on the order of millimeters). In my practice,I generally classify profile based upon patient preference. A higher profile provides a more dramatic look (size for size) vs. a moderate (+) profile which is relatively more subtle and understated. That being said the vast majority of patients will select a moderate + profile device (especially those seeking a more natural and subtle result).I often find it is easier to decide on a profile (rather than a volume), this combined with BWD will determine volume. Trying to match a particular volume to a profile may lead a BWD mismatch.In my practice, smaller framed individuals do prefer higher profile devices. I discourage pursuing significant volume as this is a hallmark of the augmented or fake look. Small girls typically have smaller breasts. Over-sizing leads to a frame mismatch which is not natural. The difference between mod (+) profile and high profile is subtle and less dramatic than the difference between low profile and the alternatives. Ultimately, it is a choice between more or less subtlety.With regards to your specific question, HP vs. moderate often becomes a question of subtle vs. dramatic. Most patients do very well with a middle of the road profile. However, for smaller framed individuals a HP device is, at times, the only way they can reach reach an adequate volume goal without exceeding their BWD.As always, discuss your concerns with a board certified plastic surgeon (ABPS).Donovan Rosas MDBoard Certified by theAmerican Board of Plastic SurgeryMember: American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery,American Society of Plastic SurgeonsRealSelf Top 100RealSelf Hall of Fame","Donovan Rosas, MD answers: Breast width 10cm.

I always reduced and lifted the mons pubis as part of a tummy tuck. personally Im more motivated to create good results than I am trying to squeeze more money out of people so people have different ways of doing this. In the end value is hard to describe. Whats worth $2000 to one person may not be worth anything to someone else. Anytime patients pay for a plastic surgery procedure they have a right to know what theyre getting for their money. This in my opinion would include seeing proper before and after pictures. If the surgeon does this as a separate procedure then he or she must have had cases in the past who opted to do the pubic lift or not do the pubic lift. It would seem fair to be shown a comparison. Another option is to simply look carefully at all of the before and after pictures of straight tummy tucks without pubic lifts and see if that gives enough of a result to not need the extra procedure.Judge plastic surgeon ability to deliver quality tummy tux based on who gets the most natural looking bellybuttons consistently. I recommend all patients have multiple in person consultations before choosing a provider. During those consultations ask each provider to show their entire collection before and after pictures asking especially to see as many pictures as possible a patient with similar body characteristics to around.The hallmarks of a quality tummy tuck is generally a natural looking belly button with a low sets car that follows anatomic contours naturally. really well done tummy tucks should have the scar set so low that much of the mons pubis has been removed.I also recommend viewing the results from all angles including from behind if possible. Talented plastic surgeon will design the procedure so that the torso looks balanced an appropriate from all angles including when viewed from behind. this means some patients may need a more extended procedure while others may need liposuction in conjunction to the procedure to shape the torso correctly.

12481791,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding whether you can get rid of your vertical scar from prior surgery and undergo an extended tummy tuck. First, I would suggest you have a horizontal component to your tummy tuck; this means an incision would be made horizontally from hip to hip to reduce excess skin and fat from your lower abdomen, mons region. Usually, during a horizontal tummy tuck, the excess skin and fat are removed just above the belly button are removed. In your case, The only part of the scar that will be removed is the portion below the belly button. Therefore, not a large portion of your scar will be removed with the horizontal tummy tuck. If you have a fleur de lis incision, the horizontal tummy tuck is already communicated with a vertical scar which you already have. Therefore, the scar will be revised. In my opinion, I would not do the fleur de lis because it could compromise and jeopardize your hernia repair. In my opinion, I would have the horizontal tummy tuck by itself. I would then consider doing laser scar revision with a Fraxel laser or even micro needling. The fleur de lis or surgical revision scar would not yield as good results as laser treatment.

	Most Moms have some sagging and deflation of their breasts after having children. This is normal, and unfortunately permanent.

	The options to lift and perk up the breasts after they sag are two-fold:

	1. Invest in a sturdy, well-padded bra that does the trick!

	2. Invest in a permanent surgical procedure to lift your breasts.

	Surgery to lift the breast may include rearrangement of the breast tissue and removal of excess skin, decreasing the size of the areolas and lifting them to a higher and more aesthetically pleasing position on the breasts. This is known as a breast lift.

	Occasionally, a breast implant is placed to add back volume lost with pregnancy and breastfeeding.

10875280,question,,"It is not unusual to hear extra names of procedures that are normally included in one procedure. This is  done to justify a higher price. Some times the mons pubis requires some liposuction to debulk it. The TT has to be extended as far as needed in the flanks in order to eliminate the excess skin in that area. There is no need to call that a flank-plasty. These are all part of the TT procedure as we want to achieve the best results for the patient and not end up with extra skin hanging on the sides. We also hear facelift and neck lift as if they were two different procedure. In fact every facelift has to address the neck and the surgeon has to attempt to get the best results in the neck when he does a facelift. Having said this I have to admit that every procedure has to be individualized. Every TT is not the same, just like every facelift is not the same. I always see the patients before I quote them a price, or we give the patients a price range, if they haven't been examined in person yet. This is why you really can't shop around on the phone for plastic surgery procedures.  You will require a TT with muscle plication to improve your bulging. You will also benefit from some liposuction in the flanks and extension of the skin resection as far to the sides as needed to avoid dog ears and not have excessive laxity on the hips.

5379413,question,,"Each plastic surgeon has his or her own unique technique for determining the amount of skin resection appropriate for each patient.That being said, if you were my patient, I undermine all the way up to the bottom of the sternum, and at times, if necessary, onto the ribs for a distance for about 1 to 1-1/2. In surgery, after repairing the muscle separation (rectus diastasis), we flex the table to 30 - 35 degrees at the hip, therefore allowing the greatest amount of skin removal and still allowing the patient to stand up straight after 8-9 days. Since every patient has a different amount of elasticity and since I want to keep the scar as low as possible, I draw three horizontal lines in the mons pubic area. The first line, which is the one I incised at the beginning of the surgery, is a fail safe position and usually higher than I end up placing the incision at the end of the surgery. The second line is lower than the first, and I consider it in baseball terms, a three bagger meaning it's good but not absolutely what I want. The third line is two finger breadths or approximately 1 above the vagina. This allows a very low scar and an increased upward pull on the vulva which very often corrects stress incontinence. These three lines are directly above the vagina and within the pubic hair area.The lateral lines up from these three lines is always directly in the crease between the thigh and the abdomen. This keeps the incision low and pretty much guarantees coverage of the abdominoplasty scar by the smallest bikini. This plus the abdominal muscle repair yields a flat abdomen which looks great in a bikini or low rise jeans and an open midriff. ","S.

12239700,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding what procedures you need to address the front and back of your torso. Congratulations on your weight loss of 120 pounds. Before you consider reconstructive plastic surgery after massive weight loss, your weight should be stable for approximately 3 to 6 months. Once your weight is stable, then you can consider these procedures. In regards to your stomach, I would suggest an extended tummy tuck. This includes permanent elimination of excess skin of the abdomen and hips, pubic (mons) lift and reduction, recreation of the belly button, and abdominal muscle tightening. For your arms, I would suggest an arm lift, arm reduction, or brachioplasty. This includes arm liposuction as well as removal of excess skin and fat from your elbow to your armpit. For your back fat and back skin rolls, I would suggest a torsoplasty. There are two types of torsoplasties. Your best torsoplasty option would be a horizontal torsoplasty or a bra strap-plasty. During the horizontal torsoplasty procedure, an incision is made across your back, ideally underneath her bra strap line. A butterfly area of excess back skin and fat is eliminated.  Another option is the vertical torsoplasty. During a vertical torsoplasty, an incision is made from the armpit down the side of your torso. Sometimes the incision goes to the bottom portion of the bra, sometimes the bottom of the ribs, and sometimes to the top of the hip. The extent of the vertical torsoplasty incision depends on the individual patient. The main advantage of the vertical torsoplasty over the horizontal torsoplasty is that the vertical torsoplasty scar is hidden. However, in your case your best results would be obtained with the horizontal torsoplasty, rather than the vertical torsoplasty.Many of these procedures can be combined or they can be done in three stages.

I tried to identify this surgical intervention in medical literature but could not find any article. Therefore, I kindly request that Dr. Goodman provide a detailed description of the operation so other surgeons and I can familiarize ourselves with this procedure. 	Analyzing the attached photos, this patient does not present sagging labia majora at all; however, there is a typical sign of the labia majora adipose sac multiple defects (I did the research on this topic and published my findings in the mainstream medical journal). Additionally, I described and published how to treat this condition surgically. Any tissue resection of the labia majora will not improve its look and will change the labia to a flat structure. 	Following Dr. Goodmans therapeutic advice to perform a labia majora lift does not make sense since the presented labia majora here does not meet the clinical diagnostic criteria of sagging labia. A labia majora lift requires to repair of 3-anatomical structures to reconstruct (the superficial mons pubis fascia, adipose sac, and Colles fascia). I do not know that a double-hockey-stick procedure will repair the necessary structures to meet the standard requirement for a labia majora lift. 	Labia majora cannot close because it is pushed laterally by the enlarged and folded labia minora. Therefore, this case will improve esthetically without compromising the function of these two structures by reconstructing labia majora adipose sac and labia minora reduction.

	The timing of a face lift is very individual. When the sagging and signs of aging start to bother you, you may consider facial rejuvenation. The need for a youthful appearance is influenced by occupation, location, and who your friends are. A public figure or TV star will be less tolerant of a jowl or nasolabial fold than a soccer mom who doesn&#39;t have any friends who have had cosmetic surgery.

	My test for performing any cosmetic surgery is a series of questions:

	Can the patient tell me what is bothering her?

	Can I see what the patient is complaining about?

	Do I have a safe and rational way to correct and improve the feature?

	Can my patient understand when I explain the surgery, risks, alternatives and benefits of the proposed treatment?

	When these four conditions are met, we are safe to go ahead with surgery.

	How long the surgery lasts is determined by the amount of aging that you have before the first surgery, your skin elasticity, sun exposure, heredity and how critical you are of your appearance. Most patient who want to keep up with their appearance will repeat a Facelift every 7-10 years. Some are longer and others shorter. Remember the moment you finish surgery, you are aging again. Face lifts set back the clock, they do not stop it.

2266768,question,,"The ideal result and one of the main reasons for a tummy-tuck is to allow you to wear a two piece bathing suit.A tummy tuck can recreate a nice hour-glass waist eliminating the boyish figure, give you a pre-preganancy belly-button that is vertical and eliminate or reduce extra skin, fat and stretch marks.

	Thanks for your question

	Yes you can have a child even if you&#39;ve already had a tummy tuck.&nbsp; The hormones of pregnancy will once again allow the abdominal wall muscles to stretch during childbearing.&nbsp; I think it would be important that you let your obstetrician know that you have had&nbsp;a tummy tuck just in case you need a&nbsp;c section.

	I would wait at least six months or more after&nbsp;surgery before getting pregnant but frankly if you&#39;re thinking of getting pregnant within six months after your tummy tuck it would probably make more sense to have your tummy tightened after your pregnancy.&nbsp; If you do it before your pregnancy there&#39;s a pretty good chance you may want another tummy tuck.

	It is very difficult to comment without photos.&nbsp; But if you were sagging before the surgery, without a lift you will still be sagging.&nbsp; You could have gone bigger, but you would have to go with a more projecting implant to keep the base diameter without your range.&nbsp; A higher profile implant would also give you more upper pole fullness.

Congratulations on your significant weight loss. What an accomplishment!Lets analyze your pictures. Examination of your abdomen reveals excess skin, excess fat, and a weakened rectus abdominis muscle. Therefore, I would highly suggest an abdominoplasty. Relying solely on abdominal liposuction might leave you with excess skin. While you can combine liposuction with the tummy tuck, the tummy tuck or abdominoplasty is essential. This procedure will eliminate the excess skin and fat, repair or tighten the rectus abdominis muscle, and lift and reduce the pubic or mons region.Turning to your breasts, you have noticeable asymmetry, with one breast larger than the other. Additionally, your left breast sags more than the right. Given these observations, a breast lift would be beneficial. The next consideration is size: do you want your breasts larger, smaller, or the current size? If you desire larger breasts, you might consider implants. For smaller breasts, a reduction would be apt. If you wish to retain the current size, an anchor or inverted T mastopexy would be ideal.Combining the abdominoplasty and breast surgery can be done in a single procedure, commonly termed a mommy makeover. This might also encompass liposuction of the flanks or abdomen. However, it's vital to first attain and stabilize at your target weight for at least three months before considering this surgical intervention. Proceeding with plastic surgery before reaching your weight objective isn't typically advisable.Good luck, and I hope you reach your goal soon and consider the rewarding impact of a mommy makeover as the final chapter in your weight loss journey.Sincerely,Dr. Katzen","J.

But the decision will always start and end with the patient. When it comes to sizing, we have all of our patients find 3 photos of their desired breast size. We ask for naked breast photos because clothing can obscure the true size (push up bras). Next, we consult with patients and go over the photos and take detailed breast measurements during a physical exam. Next, we using a sizing algorithm to determine a range of implants that will work based on the exam and the measurements.Lastly, during the operation, we use silicone sizers in the operating room to see how the size actually looks in the breast. We sit the patient up in the operating room, while asleep of course, and compare the sizer result with their desired look photos. If it is too small, we start the process over with a slightly larger implant.

Even in my own patients , I will vary the incision somewhat depending on the anatomy presented. For the most part, I use an incision that is very low and goes straight out towards the hip bone. I always try and limit my incision realizing that patients always desire smaller incisions. Living and practicing in Miami for the past 29 years I've grown to know the deep desire women have for wearing a bikini which for the most part extends upward and not straight across. I don't do the Smile incision where it curves up like in a Happy Face.I encourage you to look at many, many photographs. You need to determine if there is consistency to the work. Are the results of that particular surgeon reproduced more often than not? Your surgeon should be certified  by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and have countless years of experience.

	Others have said it quite well, and I will add my recommendation to theirs--do not expose your baby to any kind of medications or anesthetic drugs that might become part of your breast milk. Sure, you can pump and store, but you can also wait, make sure you are at your ideal post-baby weight, and proceed when you are finished breast feeding.

	The fact that you are asking means you are a mom who understands there may well be some concern here. Follow that awareness, and those who recommend you hold off for now--these are the physicians who care about you as a patient rather than as a potential case and income. I know you too may be anxious to proceed, but if you are a good candidate for this surgery now, you will be even more so when you know you are absolutely avoiding any breast milk medication influence on your new baby!

13254152,question,,"Hello FreshStart0311,Thank you for your question about the possibility of combining a lower body lift with a Fleur de Lis (FDL) procedure, and for providing your pictures and history.Let's clarify what each procedure involves:A 360 Circumferential Lower Body Lift includes a tummy tuck, rectus abdominis muscle plication, pubic lift and reduction, hip lift and reduction, and a buttock lift.The Fleur de Lis (FDL) involves both horizontal and vertical tummy tucks, removing excess skin and fat from the abdomen in both directions, along with pubic reduction and rectus abdominis muscle plication.The primary distinction between the FDL and the 360 circumferential lower body lift is the vertical removal of abdominal skin and fat in the FDL, whereas the lower body lift includes a posterior lift.Therefore, it is indeed possible to combine a 360 circumferential lower body lift with an FDL. Essentially, the surgery you are considering is a 360 circumferential lower body lift with an additional vertical incision extending from the mons pubis to the xiphoid process.Most plastic surgeons would recommend a 360 circumferential lower body lift for addressing issues with the pubic region, rectus muscle diastasis (particularly below the bellybutton), and excess skin and fat around the abdomen, hips, and buttocks. However, experienced board-certified plastic surgeons specializing in 360 circumferential lower body lifts generally observe that there is not a significant amount of vertical excess skin and fat in cases like yours. The vertical excess is often due to rectus muscle distention rather than loose skin, leading many to conclude that a vertical tummy tuck component may not be necessary.I hope this clarifies whether a combination of a 360 circumferential lower body lift and an FDL is advisable in your case.Sincerely,Dr. Katzen","J.

13024096,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding whether youre a good candidate for a mommy makeover and what is your ideal weight. Thank you for your history and your pictures. Based on your history with your maximum weight of 220 and your fittest at 140, I would suggest you should try to hit a target weight of 150 pounds. I believe that should be a realistic target or ideal weight. The best way to achieve this goal is with a ketogenic diet, minimal carbs, and eliminating sugar, alcohol, and sugary soft drinks. Your diet should be mostly protein and vegetables. You may also want to consider intermittent fasting. This should all be combined with cardio and strength training exercises. Cardio training should be done daily for 30 to 40 minutes and weightlifting three or more days a week. After you achieve the weight of approximately 150 lbs., I would say you would be a good candidate for a mommy makeover. The mommy makeover would include a tummy tuck with elimination of excess skin and fat of the abdomen, rectus abdominis muscle plication, and a pubic or mons lift. In addition, if you desire, breast surgery can be performed. A breast lift with or without augmentation is commonly performed during a mommy makeover. However, in your pictures, you included arms. Perhaps you are seeking arm liposuction, or an arm reduction during your mommy makeover? This can be added, but is not a common procedure during a mommy makeover. Therefore, in conclusion, I would suggest a target weight of 150 lbs. Once you have achieved 150 lbs and plateau there for at least three months or more, then you would be a good candidate for a mommy makeover. Good luck.Sincerely,Dr. Katzen","J.

277038,question,,"The recovery from subpectoral breast augmentation used to be a rather unpleasant experience, but it no longer has to be. A space for the implant must be developed behind the pectoralis major, and a portion of the muscle's inferior origin must be released. Surgery on a muscle in most cases produces significant postoperative pain, and that is certainly true for breast augmentation. However, by using a local anesthetic infusion device (the On-Q 'Pain Buster') for the first two to three days after surgery, the pain associated with this procedure can be reduced quite dramatically.	While breast augmentation patients in this practice receive a prescription for a mild narcotic pain medication for use after surgery (just in case), most of them never take it. Most patients report little to no pain in the evening following surgery, and perhaps some mild discomfort on Postop day one and two. Patients can resume all normal, non-strenuous activities of daily living immediately after surgery, and can begin pec major range of motion exercises on the evening of their procedure.	Patients are seen in the office the day after surgery, and again on Friday for removal of the Go-Pump catheters (which is painless). Working patients usually return to work the Monday following the surgery; stay-at-home moms may need some help with toddlers for the first two to three days after surgery. Exercise is limited to walking only for the first two weeks; in weeks three and four some light exercise is permissible. Patients can gradually increase their exercise/workout level in the second month (weeks five through eight), however it is a full eight weeks before patients are allowed to return to activities that require forceful, repetitive, sustained pec major contraction - such as pushups and heavy weight lifting.

5164284,question,,"Good luck with your procedure, happyfeet101. I wrote an article a couple of months ago for Obesity Help about preparing for body contouring surgery after weight loss. While you may not be a bariatric patient, many of the suggestions in the article really apply to preparation for any surgery. This is an excerpt: Fill your scripts in advance. Consider getting a stool softener to combat constipation related to pain medications and probiotics if you get GI distress from antibiotics. Consider throat lozenges and chapstick, as well. Load your fridge with foods easy to digest, low in sodium to limit swelling, and high in protein to aid healing. Make certain that there are plenty of fluids to maintain hydration. Consider food preparation before surgery. Prepare 1-2 recovery spaces in your home with pillows for positioning, the TV remote, books, and your computer Have batteries and chargers, sports bottles for no spill drinking, and maybe a notepad and pen handy to jot down questions and concerns. Set up comfortable sleeping arrangements. Prepare comfortable clothing that will be easy to change into and out of, preferably with some pockets for drains. Consider robes and slippers. Purchase dressing supplies in advance. Buy bathing supplies in case your surgeon restricts showers and baths. Prepare the rest of the home by completing other projects: mow the lawn, do the dishes, take care of laundryHope that is helpful. In terms of showers and movement, you really need to discuss your surgeon's preferences. Many patients stage operations and Iusually recommend about 3 months between procedures, not that there is any specificmedical reason for that suggestion. I just feel that after any surgery, individuals feel like patients and often have restrictions on their life for about 6 weeks. I like patients to then go back to being a person and enjoyingtheir regular life for 6 weeks before undergoing another elective operation. Best of luck!","Larry Lickstein, MD answers: Arm lift.

7592018,question,,"Patientsmust understand the limits of the surgery. Implants will notcreate cleavage in the sense that they cannot medialize wide or lateral set breasts. The implants will be centered on your native breast mound which may seemingly worsen the wide set nature of the breasts without actually changing the measurements. It is often helpful to think of breast augmentation as a magnifying glass or IMAX screen where all aspects of the breast are enlarged (+) and (-).One option for creating a more central or medial mound is subglandular augmentation. In this scenario,the medial boundary as defined by the pectoralismuscle attachments to the sternum arenot present. This can allow for greater medial dissection and by association greater cleavage (not recommended). However, this does in crease the risk of symmastia. There is also the risk of deformity which stems from failure to center the implant on the native breast mound.Ultimately, cleavage is essentially a function of the anatomic starting point. If you have wide set breasts, implants are only likely to accentuate this deficit. However, patients with closely spaced breasts will accentuate their cleavage via augmentation.In my practice, most patients do well with a mod (+) profile device. Those with a narrower frame may choose a higher profile device for greater projection and volume at a given width. An ultra high profile would be further along on this same continuum. Fullness will change with greater volume, cleavage will be unaffected (outside of a supportgarment).As always, discuss your concerns with a board certified plastic surgeon (ABPS).","Donovan Rosas, MD answers: Would high profile or ultra high give me the fullest looking cleavage?

	I tell my patients to wait at least 3 monhs before passing judgment on liposuction.&nbsp; It is important to make sure you are back to your regular diet and exercise routine and that you are at your post liposuction weight.&nbsp; In your case, that would be 600 grams (about 1.3 lbs).&nbsp; Patients can get pretty out of shape in just a few weeks of low activity when recovering from surgery.

	If you want to see how much was taken, get about 2 and 1/2 sticks of butter and take a look.&nbsp; That is how much was removed.

	If you need to have more removed, that can be done.&nbsp; This is a much better situation than your doctor taking too much and leaving irregularities or a too thin (yes, too thin) layer of fat.&nbsp; That situation can be very hard to treat.&nbsp;

The blepharoplasty removes excess skin from your eyelid (in a mirror, place your hand on your forehead to elevate your eyebrow to a pleasant position, and judge if you still have excess skin on your upper eyelid - I'd expect you will notice some.)

	As long as you are definitely done with having kids, you can consider a tummy tuck procedure.&nbsp; A tummy tuck (also called abdominoplasty) is a very popular cosmetic surgery procedure for Moms. A tummy tuck can be an effective tool for shaping and sculpting the body for better body appearance and improved self esteem.

Tummy tuck plastic surgery actually tightens abdominal muscles and removes excess fat and skin from the stomach area to create a tighter, slimmer, smoother belly.

	The answer to your question depends on several things. &nbsp;First, what sort of work do you do? &nbsp;Is it a desk job or does it require heavy lifting or strenuous activity? &nbsp; Second, what procedures will be part of your mommy makeover?

	Most surgeons refer to a &quot;mommy makeover&quot; as a series of cosmetic surgery procedures intended to restore a woman&rsquo;s figure after pregnancy. I perform these procedures as part of a &ldquo;mommy makeover&rdquo; for patients who want an improved figure after having children. Pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding can take a serious toll on a woman&rsquo;s body, and many moms find that no amount of diet and exercise can restore their pre-baby figures.

	&nbsp;

	Procedures commonly performed during mommy makeovers include:

	Abominoplasty (tummy tuck)Breast Augmentation +/- Lift, or Breast Lift only without implants, liposuction

	These procedures can be performed in one stage or multiple stages depending on the patient&#39;s goals, health status and other screening criteria. After pregnancy, breasts can lose their youthful position and shape, the tummy can become stretched and lose its tone, and extra fat may get deposited in areas that are not so flattering. The plastic surgery procedures above are intended to correct those conditions and help restore your pre-pregnancy figure.

	Best of luck.

The best in body contouring not only removes fat with energy devices like VASERultrasound but also internally heat the skin with radio-frequency devices such as J PLASMA/RENUVION, InMode BodyTite, ThermiRF to heat the under surface of the skin and tighten it at the same time as fat removal. These combinations are called 4D HIDEFVASERcontouring and can only be done by a well . trained body contouring specialist. At the same time fat should be harvested, PRP and stem cells added and injected into muscles or indentations/cellulite to get body shaping and contouring. This is known as a Brazilian butt lift when you inject the fat to the buttock for contouring and lifting, but fat can also be used in areas such as the chest/breast, arms/shoulders, calves and face. Cellulite should also be treated with cellfina, sculptra, subcision and/or fillers such as bellafill, renuva synthetic fat, or sculptra. If skin is very loose before surgery then it will need to be removed such as lower abdominal skin (tummy tuck/abdominoplasty), breast skin (breast lift), arm skin (brachioplasty). Overall you need a full assessment, but simple liposuction alone will not tighten skin and needs a combination of various methods -- fat removal, skin tightening, defining, fat grafting, skin removal -- to get the best in body contouring and body sculpting.

2540721,question,,"Thankyou for your question. You will get the best answer to your question byscheduling an in person consultation with a plastic surgeon certified by theAmerican Board of Plastic Surgery and discuss your unique situation andconcerns. The surgeon would meet with you, examine you, physically feeling thetissue, assessing your desired outcome, taking a full medical history, anddiscussing the pros and cons of each operative procedure in person and what torealistically expect. Then you can make an informed decision on whichprocedure(s) to start with according to your desires, recovery time necessary,your history and current health. Liposuction of the Mons Pubis area is much more common than most people know and is a good solution for this problem. The extra skin on your abdomen may make you a tummy tuck candidate but again you need an i consult. The cost of these proceduresvaries from practice and location but the cost of not going to a licensedFacility and Surgeon just to save money can end up costing much more in thelong run. Most important is to pick a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon -Certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. It can be hard andconfusing for consumers when a physician may tell you they are Board Certified.Make sure it is Board Certified in Plastic Surgery as many Physicians arecertified but it is in another area such as Dermatology, Gynecology, ENT, orsome other specialty that does not have the years of training and Certificationin Plastic Surgery required to be a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon.Rather than finding a non-certified surgeon thatmay give you better pricing it can be helpful to find a newer Board CertifiedPlastic Surgeon that has years of experience in training and surgery-requiredto become Board Certified in Plastic Surgery but is newer in practice. Theyhave the latest up to date training and highest standards as currently set bythe newest technology and are able to pass on to the consumer much betterpricing.

I do tell all of mypatients to refrain from heavy working out, heavy lifting or going to the gymor raising their blood pressure for 6 weeks after surgery. However, with that being said, with youngchild at home sometimes there is just no way to avoid picking up the baby. Keep in mind that often you have help aroundthat you may not realize and that you were used to doing everything yourself. Use the help that is around you. For example, other people can hand you thebaby while you are sitting and try to avoid reaching out to pick anything upincluding the baby. Another example, insteadof reaching down with your arms, you can bend down with your legs and use thestrength of your leg muscles rather your abdominal and upper body muscles.

12066275,question,,"Typically when patients undergo liposuction they often address 2 or more sites at the same operative procedure. In many instances they may have multiple areas liposuctioned. As an example, a patient who comes in for liposuctioning of the abdomen may also undergo liposuctioning of the mons pubis, back and flanks to create overall improved contouring of the trunk region. Similarly, for the lower extremities patients often treat the outer thighs, inner thighs and knees at the same operative procedure. It is not unusual for patients to also add in submental (neck) liposuctioning at the same time as other areas are being addressed. First and foremost, it is important that the patient is evaluated by a board-certified plastic surgeon before undergoing liposuctioning to determine if this is the optimal procedure to achieve the patient's desired results. In cases where patients will have poor skin quality excisional surgery, such as an abdominoplasty, would yield a better result than liposuctioning alone as the latter could just create looser, empty appearing skin which hangs in a more dependent fashion. When multiple areas are being treated I find the best results are achieved when the patient is under general anesthesia. That way they have a more positive experience and do not experience discomfort, not only from the liposuctioning but also initially from the tumescent fluid which is placed in the tissues in order to provide analgesia as well as vasoconstriction to decrease bleeding, swelling and bruising. If the patient is having multiple areas treated under local analgesia only or with IV sedation then they may experience more discomfort which could limit the surgeons ability to adequately remove the excess adipose tissue. Furthermore, when the patient is under general anesthesia it is easier to move them about during the surgical procedure to obtain optimal results.","Douglas L.

Unfortunately, cosmetic surgery down here as also given rise to a number of mom and pop clinics who perform surgeries at unimaginable low prices. Buyer beware.The key is............ does the surgeon have a keen sense of aesthetics? Can he/she create a shapely, attractive buttock or are they just technicians that wind up with large unshapely behinds? The same holds true for the liposuction portion of the procedure. Understand that liposuction whether SAL, PAL or UAL ( not including LAL because the fat obtained through this technique will not be useful) is not that technically challenging. However, the keen aesthetic eye will determine the eventual work of art.We are creators and have the ability to turn out beautiful works of art. Simply put................not all artists create quality work.Always seek out the opinion of a surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery with years of experience in liposuction and fat transfers . Furthermore request to see before and after photos of previous patients by that doctor....not a clinic or surgery center. Do your homework......research and verify the doctor's credentials. Have they had problems with the Board of Medicine, disciplinary or otherwise. Any law suits?How about the center, clinic or facility? Are they accredited by a national organization or do they just have State approval. Understand that at the current time, there are three nationally recognized organizations responsible for the highest levels of patient safety, AAAASF, AAACH and JCHO. You owe it to yourself to position yourself for the best possible results but under the most stringent safety regulations.How about anesthesia?

	Starting with the straightforward question, yes, the breast surgery and tummy tuck are usually done in one setting.&nbsp;

	Now, timing. &nbsp;You will&nbsp;want&nbsp;your surgeon to be able to assess the amount of excess tissue in the abdomen and breasts, and the amount of breast tissue&nbsp;compared&nbsp;with your size goals, so that a proper implant size is chosen.&nbsp;

	I usually takes 4 to 6 months for the abdominal wall to shrink back to or toward normal, and only then can the surgeon assess properly how much excess to remove, and how tight to do the muscle repair.&nbsp;

	For the breast, this will take 3-6 months after nursing is complete.

	Lastly to factor is in terms of timing is your obligation at home or work. Expect to need full time help for at least two weeks, possibly longer. People with infants to consider are often back to work at 10 days if work is non-physical. As a father of five, I know that stay -at -home mom work is highly physical.&nbsp;

	Use this time to shop and choose your surgeon.&nbsp;

	When you ready for an in person consultation, RealSelf has listings of surgeons in your area. You should consider cross referencing the listings from the The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (plasticsurgery dot org). A listing in the ASPS website assures you that your surgeon is not only board certified,&nbsp; but also is a member in good standing of the major plastic surgery organization in the U. S.

	First of all you are absolutely correct in that its only a month out and there is a lot of swelling therefore it is very difficult to judge any aspect of your outcome including a polly beak deformity.&nbsp; That being said a trained surgeon will likely be able to look at your nose and feel the bridge and have an idea of whether you are forming it or not.&nbsp; There are several causes and depending on the cause you will have different times that it shows up and different treatment options.&nbsp; I

	f the reason you have it is due to inadequate reduction of your hump then you may see that as early as a month and it will likely get worse and the only solution is re-operation to remove the left over cartilage.&nbsp;

	If however the cause is fluid and scar tissue build up then it usually takes 2-3 months.&nbsp; The treatment is often aggressive taping and sometimes injection of different anti-inflammatory agents into the area.&nbsp;

	Finally if the cause is because your tip support is weak and you projection falls then again you can tell that sometimes as early as 2-3 mons and the only treatment will be re-operation to correct the tip position.&nbsp;

	Bottom line is that even if you are creating it and have to re-operate, you should not touch your nose for 6-12 months after your initial surgery.&nbsp; Otherwise you may make it worse.&nbsp; Be patient and many times things will get better.

	Most surgeons refer to a &quot;mommy makeover&quot; as a series of cosmetic surgery procedures intended to restore a woman&rsquo;s figure after pregnancy. I perform these procedures as part of a &ldquo;mommy makeover&rdquo; for patients who want an improved figure after having children. Pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding can take a serious toll on a woman&rsquo;s body, and many moms find that no amount of diet and exercise can restore their pre-baby figures. It is very common for me to perform procedures on the breast as well as the tummy in one setting - hence one procedure - one recovery.

	Procedures commonly performed during mommy makeovers include: Abominoplasty (tummy tuck)Breast Augmentation +/- Lift, or Breast Lift only without implants, liposuction

	These procedures can be performed in one stage or multiple stages depending on the patient&#39;s goals, health status and other screening criteria. After pregnancy, breasts can lose their youthful position and shape, the tummy can become stretched and lose its tone, and extra fat may get deposited in areas that are not so flattering. The plastic surgery procedures above are intended to correct those conditions and help restore your pre-pregnancy figure. Please visit with a ASPS member surgeon to review your options.","C.

	This definitely is where you need better communication between you and your plastic surgeon.&nbsp; Please ask him or her exactly what they believe this lump may be.&nbsp;

	Having said that, this is very unlikely or almost impossible to be an incision hernia since there are no incisions below your abdominoplasty incision during a tummy tuck.&nbsp; My best guess is that this is probably some blood mixed with fat in the area of your mons pubis, or when placing the deep sutures to sew together the SFS (superficial fascia system), your surgeon may have caught a large bunch of tissue here, and this should vanish with time.&nbsp;

	In my practice, I would use ultrasound on this area (the kind the physical therapist use for sore muscles and not the ultrasound used to see the baby in your stomach).&nbsp; This brings blood supply to the area and removes most lumps.&nbsp;

	If this lump doesn't go away by 3 months after surgery and you still don't feel comfortable with what your plastic surgeon told you, then a second opinion of another Board Certified Plastic Surgeon might be appropriate, but I am pretty sure this lump will vanish by then.

12628253,question,,"Thank you for your question about whether things will get worse and if the numbness will disappear after a 360 body lift. In addition, thank you for your question about needing revisions for your 360 body lift. First, I suggest you embark upon an aggressive diet of high protein and low carbs. I would also suggest both cardiac and weight training to optimize your weight. Finally, try to decrease your percent body fat if you have exhausted these avenues and are still at a low percent body fat and your weight is still stable. You may consider revisions.Regarding revisions, you may require either liposuction of your flanks or a vertical torsoplasty. During a vertical torsoplasty, an incision is made from just underneath the bra to the top of the panty line. This will give you more of an hourglass figure. Indeed some plastic surgeons call a vertical torsoplasty a hourglassing procedure.Regarding your mons, most plastic surgeons specializing in plastic surgery after massive weight loss directly respect fat from this area. Liposuction is suboptimal. Therefore, in the pubic region, you may require an incision over the pubic region, dissection into the pubic region, and fat resection. Regarding your saddlebags, these areas may be best treated with liposuction. It could be possible that the saddlebags are more noticeable since the excess skin and fat from above the hips were removed with the body lift. Indeed it can also be due to swelling. The results and the numbness are not related. It is not valid. As the numbness goes away, the skin will stretch. It doesn't work that way. All in all, I would give yourself some time, and if you do not like your results six months post-op and do not like your results, please visit your plastic surgeon.

3680762,question,,"Although the literature claims that African American women tend to have thicker and darker scars in general, that has not been my experience. Each individual, no matter what their ethnic background, form scars based on the quality of the surgery, location on the body, and their personal genetics. If you have other scars on your body that are either thin or thick, they would be an indicator of what type of scar formation you can expect to have.That being said, previous C-section scars are one major exception. With a C-section, no skin is removed, therefore minimal tension. Once the baby is removed from the uterus, stretched out skin from the pregnancy tends to create even less tension on the C-section scar, and horizontal incisions in the mons pubis follow what is known as Langer's lines, therefore leading to some of the best scarring on any individual's body. As far as the location of the abdominoplasty scar, each surgeon has his or her own preference. If you were my patient, I would always go below C-section scars and attempt to make the midpoint of the abdominoplasty incision as low as 1 above the vaginal cleft. Sometimes, when abdominal skin has not been sufficiently stretched out, it may be necessary to make the incision just below the C-section scar, but never above it. The lateral wings of the C-section scar, as much as possible, are kept in the crease between the thigh and the abdomen. This leads to a scar easily covered by a small bikini. ","S.

As a Result of the Weight Loss, I Have no fat tissue left in my breasts, loose abdominal skin,(but hardcore abs underneath), loose skin on thighs &amp; arms Is it safe for me to undergo a tummy tuck, brachioplasty,thigh lift and breast implants all at the same time?

Since I am a personal trainer, how long can I expect to be out of work after just the tummy tuck?&quot;

	Physically speaking, a&nbsp;Tummy Tuck, Arm Lift, Thigh Lift and Breast Implants CAN be done at the the same time. But, just because such a marathon surgery can be done (and is profitable for the surgeon) does not mean you should have it done this way.

	Separating large Plastic Surgery projects into smaller surgery parcels, or staging the procedures, is much more comfortable to the patient and is associated with a much faster recovery. It allows the surgeon to do touch up corrections, if needed, on the areas previously operated. But MOST importantly, it greatly reduces the risk of complications, especially infection and blood clot formation (DVT and PE) seen with longer procedures.

	I would suggest you think about having the Tummy Tuck and Breast lift/Augmentation as the first procedure and allow it to heal. you can then have the other procedures done in the order that best suites you.

The incision is placed in a similar position to that of a lower body lift, both of which are much lower than the belt lipectomy. It gives a full tummy tuck allowing the surgeon to remove loose excess tissue from the hips and buttocks.&nbsp;The lower body lift is very similar but is performed in a much more aggressive manor, being used just about mainly for post massive weight loss patients. In most plastic surgeon's hands it allows them to perform an aggressive tummy tuck and mons lift as well as a strong lateral thigh lift and buttock lift. In a smaller proportion of surgeons an auto augmentation of the buttocks will also be performed and in my hands only an auto augmentation of the hips is done to prevent a boxy post op look and actually create more of an hour glass type look.Having described these as such please don't &nbsp;expect your ps to think of them as such,aas these have not yet been really described as such in the plastic surgery literature.Peter Fisher M.D.&nbsp;","Peter Fisher, MD answers: Circular tummy tuck and lower body lift the same thing?

And thank you for your question regarding what to do in terms of having either an extended tummy tuck her fleur-de-lis examine your abdomen above the belly button. Most of your excess skin and fat is in the vertical dimension. That means skin and fat can be mostly bunched up when the skin is pinched in an east-west fashion creating an up-and-down vertical scar. You do not have much excess skin and fat below the belly button. You do not have much excess skin and fat in any horizontal dimension when you pinch the skin from north to south. Therefore, in my opinion, you have three options. You could have a vertical abdominoplasty. Has made from the bottom of the sternum ors iPhone to the belly button and then to the Mons for the pubic region. This would eliminate excess skin in front of your tummy. Another option could be a reverse tummy tuck, or an incision is made underneath each breast. Any extra-abdominal skin is pulled upward towards your breast and permanently eliminated. Another option is a bilateral lateral vertical torsoplasty for an incision to be made down the side of your torso. Extend from just underneath the bra line down to your waistline. This would also eliminate excess skin in front of your upper abdomen.The benefit of the last two options is if the scars are hidden and are not visible on your abdomena disadvantage of the vertical tummy tuck. You do not need the fleur-de-lis abdominal plasty because youve already had the horizontal component. As you know, the verticals are the fleur-de-lis or FDL abdominoplasty has a vertical and horizontal member. Again, I dont think you need a horizontal component. Therefore, in my opinion, you do not need the extended tummy tuck or the fleur-de-lis. It would help if you had a vertical tummy tuck, reverse tummy time, or bilateral lateral. Good luck.

1534535,question,,"You pose some good questions, Mom. &nbsp;Facial asymmetry (as well as asymmetry throughout the body) is common--the two sides of the face and body are like sisters, and not twins. &nbsp;Without examining your child, I would propose that 4mm is not a significant difference between ear sizes, and likely not noticeable by the average observer. &nbsp;For example, 2-3mm difference between ear projection from the head is considered acceptable in ear-pinning surgery.Newborn ears have soft cartilage due to high level of circulating maternal estrogen; thus, a variety of cartilage issues (prominent ear, Stahl's deformity, helical rim problems, etc) may be addressed with ear splinting in the newborn period. &nbsp;This being said, your child appears to have a more prominent earlobe of the ear shown in the 1st and 3rd photos, and because the earlobe is fleshy and without cartilage, I don't think an ear splinting device such as Earwell would help with this. &nbsp;On rare occasions, I've seen the very bottom of the helical rim cartilage (the cartilage accounting for the outer rim of the ear) account for a prominent ear lobe; this is potentially splintable, even at an older age of 8 weeks.Made of cartilage, connective tissue, and skin, ears reach adult size at approximately age 5-6+ years. &nbsp;Furthermore, your child will develop the mastoid prominence (a bump of bone found on most adults immediately behind the ear lobe) at ~age 2 years, which may change the appearance of the earlobe. &nbsp;An overly prominent earlobe may be treated surgically with an incision behind the ear and conservative tissue removal or sutures. &nbsp;The name of this is otoplasty (a general term for ear-shaping surgery), or lobule-plasty.My recommendation would be to find a plastic surgeon who is experienced in ear deformities and ear surgery for an evaluation. &nbsp;An in-person exam with such a provider would hopefully give you more information and some more definitive answers. &nbsp;Good luck!","Inessa Fishman, MD answers: My infant ears are different in sizes.

Themoderate plus is the most commonly usedprofile in my practice. Itallowsfor the most reasonable volume in a given BWD.

In my practice,I generally classify profile based upon patient preference. A higher profile provides a more dramatic look (size for size) vs. a moderate (+) profile which is relatively more subtle and understated. That being said the vast majority of patients will select a moderate + profile device (especially those seeking a more natural and subtle result).I often find it is easier to decide on a profile (rather than a volume), this combined with BWD will determine volume. Trying to match a particular volume to a profile may lead a BWD mismatch.In my practice, smaller framed individuals do prefer higher profile devices.

1478235,question,,"All mommy makeover procedures begin with one important goal - DO NO HARM!. The moms that walk into my office all have unique concerns, complaints and issues. The final decision for type and extent of surgery will focus on safety first and quality of outcome second. If there is any question that safety is jeopardized then the plan is altered.My first consideration is surgical time. For surgery that extends past four hours, the risks of blood clots in the legs and infection rise. In addition, most surgeons will agree that their own skills are not as sharp when surgery drags on.The second consideration is being sure that the procedures combined will be safe at the time of surgery and will do well together in the post-op period. For instance, performing a buttock lift (lie on your stomach) and a breast lift (lie on your back) at the same time is impossible unless you plan to stand for three weeks.Weight considerations are important for the surgery as well as the long term success of the procedures. I always want my patients to be at a stable weight. It is less important to be skinny and more important to be stable. It is also important to have lost all the weight from prior pregnancies so the assessment can be accurate.The cost of the procedure is like an a la cart menu. Different procedures are added to the price. More procedures performed at one sitting does have some cost advantages including decreased anesthesia, nursing and facility fee costs. Performing all procedures at one time also allows for one recovery.For a full tummy tuck I prefer the High Lateral tension abdomenoplasty. This technique allows the best hourglass shape abdomen and also allows liposuction to be performed on the upper abdomen and the flanks.The typical time for this procedure is 2 to2 and 1/2 hours.Typical time for the thigh lift is 2 1/2 hours, breast lift with implant removal is 1 1/2 to 2 hours and the upper arm lift is 1 1/2 hours.I would consider performing the breasts and tummy together. At a second stage performing the thigh and arm lifts.I hope this is helpful.","Robert M.

6425287,question,,"Thank you for your interest.This is a very common question.As Plastic surgeons we all have our own idea regarding how we do things. This applies to recovery protocols after a tummy tuck.The time of recovery depends on how you are defining recovery.For example, after surgery you go to the recovery room. Once you have recovered you leave but what have you recovered from? You have recovered from the anesthesia to a certain extent but certainly not from the surgery.In the recovery from a tummy tuck there are common events that we all mark as milestones to recovery. These include taking stairs, sleeping on our sides or on our bellies, lifting certain items, driving, going back to work, not requiring pain medication, resuming sexual activities, returning to exercise, etc.As a surgeon I could give definitive times for these activities that would cover 99% of the patients but that would mean that the recovery instructions would be very restrictive and unrealistic; no driving, lifting, or exercise for 2 months. Those instructions would virtually assure that there would be no unforeseen issues with wound disruption but would also mean a lot of lost time for the patient.Instead,Iallow my patients to do what they feel comfortable doing. If they have too much pain doing something then I tell them to back off from that activity. This course of action is based on the idea that you will not cause yourself unnecessary pain and will restrictpainful activities until they become less painful and more tolerable. A patient would probably cause themselves unbearable pain before they disruptwhat was done surgically.This course has proved to be effective for my patients and speeds up their recovery. They are checked frequently to make certain that they are on track in their recovery.I tell patients that by 3 months after the surgery they will be 60% healed; by 6 moths 90% healed and 100% healed by 12 months. This is a rough estimate butallows the patient to get an idea of where they stand in their recovery.","John P. Stratis, MD answers: Tummy Tuck Recovery",/question/tummy-tuck-complete-recovery
72486,question,,"GillianThe mini tummy tuck removes less than half of the skin and fat between the umbilicus (belly button) and the pubic mons.  If the muscle layer is stretched out, this layer can also be repaired.  The mini tummy tuck scar length can vary based on the patient's pelvis width, but usually it is 6 to 12 inches long.  I think many patients are not good candidates for the mini-tummy tuck because, although they want a smaller scar and smaller price, the operation just does not allow for full tightening of the muscle layer and maximal removal of the stretch-marks.The full tummy tuck scar is a little longer, but it removes a lot more skin.  Most patients (over 80%) are very happy with the full tummy tuck because it meets their expectation as to the amount of stretch-mark removal and tightening of the entire muscle layer. I recommend that you have a consultation with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. They have formal training in abdominoplasty surgery and will help you determine which operation is right for you.","Daniel Reichner, MD answers: What is a mini tummy tuck?",/question/mini-tummy-tuck
1999431,question,,"Dear bevakasha,Thank you for writing in with your question.  Youre 17, so be aware that youll need parental consent for elective surgery such as a hair transplant procedure.  So, lets assume you have that.  From your pictures, it doesnt appear as though your forehead is all that large.  But my opinion is not what matters; it's how you feel thats important.  There are a couple of important considerations in play here:Future hair loss.  Youre only 17, so who knows if youll have hair loss?  You can get a pretty good estimate by looking at your dad, your dads dad, your dads brothers, your moms dad, and your moms brothers.  If they all have full heads of hair, thats a good thing and portends well for your future hairline.  If many have hair loss, this may not be a great idea at this time, as you have no idea exactly how much hair you may lose over time.  A procedure performed now, making a nice low hairline, might look odd if you start to have some crown loss in 10 years.  You might think to yourself that you wont care what you look like 10, 20, or 30 years from now, but I assure you that you will most definitely care.  The results from a hair transplant procedure are permanent.  Thats both the good and the bad thing about the results.Anatomical considerations.  One of the principles of hair restoration is that its rarely a good idea to place hair grafts on to the frontalis muscle, or the horizontal wrinkles it creates on your forehead.  The frontalis muscle is the broad, flat muscle that lies under your forehead, and is what raises your eyebrows.  Look in a mirror and raise your eyebrows as high as you can, and youll see the limit of how low you can go.My suggestion is to schedule a consultation with a hair restoration physician who is dedicated to the specialty of hair restoration, and whose area of practice is confined exclusively to the treatment of men and women with hair loss.  Many dedicated centers offer virtual consultations so you dont have to travel that far.  I would also recommend getting more than one opinion, and also involving your parents in your decision.  I hope this information is helpful to you.","Ken Anderson, MD answers: Lowering my hairline by only a couple centimeters with FUE (photo)",/question/princeton-nj-lowering-hairline-couple-centimeters-fue
133569,question,,"&quot;Bags&quot; under the eyes is a very common complaint. The soft, delicate eyeball is protected from the hard bony orbital skeleton by intra-orbital fat. The fat cushions the globe as we &quot;bounce&quot; along through the day...the fat is held into place and prevented from pushing out or herniating by the orbital septum...a very thin, tissue paper like structure located above and below the eyeball. As we age, and sometimes thanks to our genetics passed down from mom and dad, the orbital septum thins and like the sail of a boat, allows the fat to billow out. This billowing or fullness causes the bulge you are seeing, sometimes worse on one side versus the other. This fullness, or bag, casts a shadow that is percieved as a dark ring...and causes your friends to ask if you are tired!Lasers applied to the skin from the outside do not correct this issue. This fullness is from the inside fat and needs surgery.

99334,question,,"With abdominal reparative surgery, you can analyze the three key components:  skin, muscle and fascia.Muscle can indeed be tightened through the belly button with the endoscopic technique, the entire length of the abdomen.  However this technique will not remove any loose skin. For women who have a minimal looseness to the skin, a small C-section type incision can be made on the lower abdomen and the entire fascia can be tightened while a small to moderate amount of skin is removed.  This is called the hybrid abdominoplasty (TM).  It requires bariatric and endoscopic equipment and expertise.  However for very tit moms whose primary problem is one of fascia looseness, it is a nice solution.For women with a great deal of extra skin and fat, some form of the full tummy tuck will be necessary to achieve the best results, and there are many different versions of the full tummy tuck that can be customized to the patient's problems, skin looseness, existing scars, need for low incisions, etc.","Brent Moelleken, MD answers: Muscle repair through belly button?",/question/tummy-tuck-muscle-repair-belly-button

	Hi,

	&nbsp; You are the typical mom that wants to do something for herself since she has done everything for her family.

	&nbsp; Combination procedures are done in over 95% of my practice and this is in many thousands of cosmetic procedures.&nbsp; The combination of breast surgery and body contouring is one of the most common of the combination procedures.

	&nbsp; There is a significant cost savings in doing both together.&nbsp; This would pertain to the surgery fees and the hospital/anes/facility fees.

	&nbsp; My suggestion is to go to the plastic surgeon and get the opinions and costs of the procedures if they are done together or if they are done individually.&nbsp; Then, go home and figure out what course of action you want to take.&nbsp; If you decide on one only, then go after the one that bothers you the most.&nbsp;

	&nbsp;&nbsp; I personally feel that if both bother you, then wait.&nbsp; Do not do one only if during the next few months you are looking at the new contours and then saying to yourself darn, I should have done both.&nbsp;

	&nbsp; Get the information and think it over.&nbsp; This combination certainly makes mommy's happy and so are their families.

	&nbsp; Good luck with it all,

	Thanks for your question -

	In our San Francisco area office we commonly perform breast reductions.&nbsp; We always ask our patients to wait until they&#39;re done breast feeding.&nbsp; There are several reasons for this -

	
		Breast milk can cause infections and wound healing problems.
	
		Your breasts are engorged (think bigger than normal) with breast milk and the actual size and shape of your breasts will change when you stop lactating.&nbsp; It is important to perform the surgery when your breasts have reached a stable size without breast milk.
	
		Anesthesia and pain medications can get into the breast milk affecting your baby.
	
		After surgery you&#39;ll need some time to recover and typically breast feeding moms may have some trouble finding the time to devote to you.


	Two days is likely not enough time to prevent issues from point #1 and point #2.&nbsp; And you should see your surgeon as a partner in your safety and well being.&nbsp; Not telling your doctor things is a recipe for disaster.&nbsp; I hope this helps.&nbsp; Finish breast feeding and then see a board certified plastic surgeon.

12851425,question,," Dear Caracat0482,Firstly, congratulations on your weight loss! That's a significant achievement and you should be proud.Now, to address your question, it's absolutely possible to perform a breast lift, extended tummy tuck, and pubic lift concurrently, assuming you're in good health and have the necessary medical clearance from your plastic surgeon.These combined procedures are often referred to as a 'mommy makeover', although your case is due to impressive weight loss rather than post-pregnancy changes. A pubic lift (or monsplasty) is routinely performed with a tummy tuck to address concerns like yours about the appearance of the mons pubis. The goal is to provide a harmonious, balanced look to the body.As for your breasts, a lift (or mastopexy) can indeed be done at the same time as your tummy tuck, and if desired, breast augmentation could also be considered to restore volume if needed.Regarding the loose skin on your inner and upper thighs, this might require a separate procedure known as a thigh lift. While it is technically possible to do this during the same surgical session, it can significantly increase the complexity and duration of the surgery, and might not be recommended for safety reasons.Another option is to get Morpheus8 for skin tightening during your procedure. You will need multiple rounds, and no microneedling will ever compare to a thigh lift and reduction. However, that may be a good option for you if your loose skin is minimal.As always, the specifics will ultimately depend on your individual circumstances and overall health. You should have a thorough discussion with your board-certified plastic surgeon, who can provide you with a detailed, personalized plan that takes into account your goals and safety.I hope this provides a bit more clarity.

9991488,question,,"Thankyou for your question regarding whether your vagina will be different if you get a thigh lift or thigh reduction. Congratulations on your weight loss!Great job!! A 360 circumferential lower body lift includes a tummy tuck, mons lift, pubic reduction, hip lift, hip reduction, buttock lift, and buttock reduction.Often, I combine the 360 circumferential lower body lift with a thigh lift surgery.This is possible if the patient is deemed medicallyhealthy.There are several different types of thigh lifts. In your case, I would suggest a modified, inner or medial thigh lift.The modified, inner or medial thigh lift would include thigh liposuction and an incision from the groin partially down the thigh. In your case, based on your pictures, I would make the incision to the point where the thigh skin starts to reattach to the inner thigh or where the thigh sag stops.I do not think I need to go to the knee with your thigh lift.Compared to the crescent or groin thigh lift, the vertical medial thigh lift minimizes any chances of altering the vaginal region. Compared to the crescent or groin thigh lift, with the vertical medial thigh lift, there is little tension applied to the vaginal area. However, if you are considering a crescent or horizontal thigh lift with an incision in the groin, this thigh lift approach can alter the vagina and labia.During the crescent or groin thigh lift, inner thigh tissue dissection is taken to the lateral borders of the labia.Then, the inner thigh is sutured to the structures underlying the labia.Labial spread can occur as a complication after the crescent thigh lift if not performed correctly.During the crescent thigh lift, tension can pull on the entranceto the vagina (introitus) and separate the labia. Therefore, if you are concerned about labial spread and the vaginal area during a thigh lift, please avoid the crescent or groin thigh lift. Indeed, also a crescentor groin thigh lift would not be optimal for you based on your thighs. Therefore, I would consider the limited incision or modified, vertical medial thigh lift. Thank you for your question regarding changes in the vagina and labial region with a thigh lift.I specialize in thigh lifts.I hope that I have answered your questions regarding the thigh reduction.If you have any more questions regarding the thigh lift, thigh reduction,vertical thigh lift, medial thigh lift, spiral thigh lift, crescent thigh lift, orthigh lipo, please contact my office.Please seek an experienced, board-certified plastic surgeonwith significant experience performing thigh lifts.

10956107,question,,"Kybella could be used that way. It is off label and considering that most people find the results in sufficient for the tiny amount of fat they want reduced under their chin doing body contouring with chemical fat distraction is really subpar.This can easily be done using local anesthesia with or without sedation.The amount of swelling and inflammation will be less with liposuction than an attempt with chemical fat distraction.Liposuction is far more predictable and can be blended better and surrounding areas.It is the gold standard and the best form of subcutaneous fat removal.The idea of injecting chemicals noxious enough to rupture cell membranes seems highly unappealing to me.  liposuction is so safe, so simple and predictable it is simply better than Kybella by every measure.A lot of people who complain of excess fat in the mons pubis also have skin laxity that contributes significantly to the problem. Its really important to differentiate how much skin laxity contributes and how much is really a true fat problem.To differentiate how much skin laxity may be contributing I suggest pulling up fairly aggressively on your lower abdomen until the skin is nice and touch and see if the area of concern changes in contour.If it does them that amount of change is purely related to skin laxity and will not be approved with fat removal.This is often the case for women whove had children or weight fluctuations.You may find a provider especially a non-MD or someone who is not trained in plastic surgery offering Kybella(those who cannot offer Liposuction).

3594297,question,,"The American Society of Plastic Surgeons has a published position on age limits for breast augmentation, and 18 years of age is the earliest age at which the Society recommends breast augmentation for purely aesthetic reasons. There may be other reasons why we would use breast implants in girls younger than 18, but these would mostly be reconstructive issues, such as taking care of congenital deformities. Having said that, from purely an age requirement, you would now be an appropriate candidate for the procedure.The other conditions to be met are whether or not the operation is medically indicated for you. That is to say, is there a sound reason to undergo the operation, are you healthy enough to have surgery, are there any medical conditions or medications that you take that might make it too risky, and so forth.Closely aligned with these are your emotional maturity and the reasons why you want the procedure. Each lady has her reasons, and while most are healthy and consistent with mature thought processes, some are not. These are all things thatneed to be determined during a personal consultation, including a detailed exam of your breasts, chest, and body type with measurements,with a board certified plastic surgeon who has lots of experience with breast surgery. They will be able to answer all of your questions about the procedure as well as provide you with all of the options that would work best to meet your goals given your body type and current breast characteristics. As you noted, in your area of the country there literally is a multitude of options for surgeons, so you should be able to find a surgeon who can do this for you. Iwould caution you to do your homework about things like board certification and what that all means, because unfortunately, not every doctor that advertises themselves as board certified to do breast augmentationis certified by an recognized board. You should only seek out real board certified plastic surgeons who are certified by The American Board of Plastic Surgery, as this is the only recognized board that certifies surgeons to perform aesthetic surgery of the breast and body. In addition to being certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, the only generally recognized organization which certifies true plastic surgeons and has the term Plastic Surgery in its title, your surgeon should also participate in the Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program administered by that board. This program requires that surgeons who participate continue to update their credentials and professional standing regularly, as opposed to practicing on a single lifetime certificate like those plastic surgeons who elect not to participate. To find further information about this program and any surgeons you might consider for your surgery, I suggest visiting these sites: abplsurg.org and abms.org. Good luck.","Dr. G (Joseph L.

3287662,question,,"While we usually restrict our patients' activities for the first few weeks and ask them to avoid strenuous upper extremity activity or excessive reaching or lifting after breast augmentation, there are many things that can be very easily done if proper common sense and care are observed. Things like reaching up gently to do your hair, getting a light bowl out of a cupboard, and things like this are just fine, as long as you are careful and not forceful. In fact, Iactually prescribe daily gentle range of motion and stretching exercises for my own patients to keep the pectoralis muscles from becoming contracted and the shoulders from stiffening. In any event, the point is that it is a fallacy that we have to walk around with the arms held to the sides for a month, as many of my patients have described through the years as T. Rex arms! Imirror most of what has been said here already by my colleagues with regard to postoperative activity. When it comes to the kids, as many of our patients are young moms with small children, we simply have to incorporate this common sense approachinto the child care.Thus, full lifting of an infant to a changing table the first week after surgery would probably not be advisable, but getting help with positioning and then snuggling and hugging is just fine. With toddlers and young children who can be cooperative, many of my patients who are moms will make a sort of game out of this, so as to not cause fear in their children. Most children are simple creatures and they like consistency and closeness.  If they can get those things, it is very likely there will be smooth sailing. If something disrupts their routine, if someone moves their cheese as the story goes, the become anxious and go crazy. If mom is anxious about hugging or providing that closeness that the child needs and is used to, a situation can spiral out of control very quickly as the child becomes frightened and their mind immediately goes to thoughts of abandonment and losing you. This is actually very important to consider, as this kind of anxiety dynamic will have a very real affect on your overall recovery after surgery. Imention these things not to make this out to be a huge ordeal; because it really isn't. It's actually quite easily controlled with a bit of information and planning up front. The other great thing about kids is that they trust us - said another way, they're gullible and can be directed by us with very limited information as long as we show them we're not leaving them and we are sincere. This reminds me of an anecdote with my own eldest daughter that Ijust can't resist sharing here. She has always been a bit of an old soul and somewhat cynical, and when she was just starting to figure out the truth about all of those fantasy characters that parents like totell their children about (sometimes more for their own benefit than the childs!) like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy, she was asking her mother one day about these things. She ran down the list with a very serious look on her face, asking one by one, Is he real? What about him What about her? In each instance, as her mother and I had decided it was time to level with her, we said (with a twinge of sadness in our hearts for her evaporating youth!) No, hes not really real, that was Mommy and Daddy pretending No, shes not really real. Each time she nodded accordingly, Yup, I knew it. Then she got to Mickey Mouse. Her mother got a sly half smile and winked at me, and said, Oh, hes actually real. You know, I actually saw my daughters eyes brighten justa bit as she said really?? and she actually believed it for another year or so. We all enjoyed Disneyland that much more during the last fleeting moments of the innocence and wonder of her little girlness. In any regard, as long as you incorporate them into the scenario some way, explain something to them that makes sense to them, and then enroll them into cooperating with the soft gentle baby bear hugs that they have to give you (or whatever works for you and your children) for a time, they will be fully on board, and actually very supportive of you. And you in turnwill feel much, much better in general during your recovery. I know this was a bit of a long winded response, but this is an important, and very common issue you raise, and Im glad to have the opportunity to share my perspectives on it.

355313,question,,"The recovery from subpectoral breast augmentation used to be a rather unpleasant experience, but it no longer has to be. A space for the implant must be developed behind the pectoralis major, and a portion of the muscle's inferior origin must be released. Surgery on a muscle in most cases produces significant postoperative pain, and that is certainly true for breast augmentation. However, by using a local anesthetic infusion device (the On-Q 'Pain Buster') for the first two to three days after surgery, the pain associated with this procedure can be reduced quite dramatically.	While breast augmentation patients in this practice receive a prescription for a mild narcotic pain medication for use after surgery (just in case), most of them never take it. Most patients report little to no pain in the evening following surgery, and perhaps some mild discomfort on Postop day one and two. Patients can resume all normal, non-strenuous activities of daily living immediately after surgery, and can begin pec major range of motion exercises on the evening of their procedure.	Patients are seen in the office the day after surgery, and again on Friday for removal of the Go-Pump catheters (which is painless). Working patients usually return to work the Monday following the surgery; stay-at-home moms may need some help with toddlers for the first two to three days after surgery. Exercise is limited to walking only for the first two weeks; in weeks three and four some light exercise is permissible. Patients can gradually increase their exercise/workout level in the second month (weeks five through eight), however it is a full eight weeks before patients are allowed to return to activities that require forceful, repetitive, sustained pec major contraction - such as pushups and heavy weight lifting.

	Before any elective surgery such as a Mommy Makeover, you should get into the best physical shape possible!

	This includes a healthy, balanced diet, regular exercise, psychological wellness, and achieving as close to your ideal weight as possible.

	As a surgeon, I take on an enormous degree of responsibility to do the very best job possible, care for my patients and ensure they are safe, happy and healthy, with a beautiful result of their Mommy Makeover.

	As a patient, you should also commit to the process by getting your body as physically ready for surgery by considering all of the points above.&nbsp; The number on the scale is less important than being fit, reducing your body fat percentage, and ensuring you are a safe candidate for surgery.&nbsp;

	There are some plastic surgeons who perform breast augmentation under IV sedation so you can find one of those if you are really wanting to. &nbsp;I usually use general anesthesia because I actually think it is safer. &nbsp;If you are under twilight sleep anesthesia (IV sedation), and something happens where you need to move to general anesthesia then you are being intubated (putting in a tube to breath for you) in an emergent situation where general anesthesia is doing the same thing in a very controlled situation. &nbsp;

	There has actually been a study that showed your chances of dying from anesthesia is greater driving to your procedure than having general anesthesia - and we drive all the time!!! &nbsp;But that being said, I know it is a huge decision because you don't have the risk if you don't have the surgery.

12650949,question,,"It's understandable that you're feeling insecure about the size and projection of your implants, as well as the gap between them. It's important to remember that breast augmentation is a highly personalized procedure, and every individual's results will vary based on factors such as body type, breast tissue, and personal preference.In terms of reducing the size and projection of your implants, it may be possible to exchange them for smaller implants, such as the 300-350cc mod or full profile implants you mentioned. This can help to create a more natural and proportionate result that aligns with your desired size and shape. However, it's important to discuss your concerns and goals with your surgeon to determine the best approach for your individual situation.Regarding the gap between your implants, this can be corrected by repositioning them closer together with a technique called internal suturing. Your surgeon may also recommend a different implant placement, such as subglandular or subfascial, to help achieve a more natural look.Finally, in regards to the softness of your implants, it's important to give them time to fully settle and soften. It's normal for implants to feel firm in the first few months after surgery, but they should gradually soften over time. If you continue to experience firmness or other concerns, be sure to discuss these with your surgeon.Overall, it's important to communicate your concerns and goals with your surgeon and work together to develop a plan to achieve the results you desire.

	Most surgeons refer to a &quot;mommy makeover&quot; as a series of cosmetic surgery procedures intended to restore a woman&rsquo;s figure after pregnancy. I perform these procedures as part of a &ldquo;mommy makeover&rdquo; for patients who want an improved figure after having children. Pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding can take a serious toll on a woman&rsquo;s body, and many moms find that no amount of diet and exercise can restore their pre-baby figures.

	Procedures commonly performed during mommy makeovers include:

	Abominoplasty (tummy tuck)Breast Augmentation +/- Lift, or Breast Lift only without implants, liposuction

	These procedures can be performed in one stage or multiple stages depending on the patient&#39;s goals, health status and other screening criteria. After pregnancy, breasts can lose their youthful position and shape, the tummy can become stretched and lose its tone, and extra fat may get deposited in areas that are not so flattering. The plastic surgery procedures above are intended to correct those conditions and help restore your pre-pregnancy figure.

	When Moh&#39;s Surgery is performed it often requires&nbsp;a flap of skin be moved into the&nbsp;defect for closure.&nbsp; This often results in a bulge at the&nbsp;base&nbsp;of the flap.&nbsp; Even when a flap&nbsp;is not neccessary the&nbsp;increased&nbsp;pressure&nbsp;created at the skin closure line&nbsp;can create a bulge at one or both ends of the closure line.&nbsp; These bulges (or bulge) usually improve with time&nbsp;and this can be hastened during the early postop period by applying pressure&nbsp;on the bugles with stretchable tape at night.&nbsp; If a noticable bugle is still&nbsp;there at&nbsp;one year it is probably be necessary to remove it with dermabrasion (sanding) or surgical excision&nbsp;that&nbsp;should leave a small surgical scar which is not be&nbsp;easily seen.

It can also include liposuction of the tummy, thighs, or other areas of the body.This is  surgery of the breast may consist a breast lift, augmentation or a combination of both.The surgery of the tummy typically is a tummy tuck procedure. The tummy tuck brings the widened six pack muscles together to flatten the tummy and removes excess skin. Lastly, liposuction can be used to sculpt the body. This is commonly performed on the flank or thighs. Recovery from a mommy makeover takes about two weeks. Its very important to have help around the house for the first two weeks as the procedure can really slow you down. Also, patients who have had a muscle repair should avoid lifting anything heavy for 4-6 weeks. This can be very important for moms with small children at home. Its best to have help and a support system in place before surgery.If you're considering fat transfer to your bottom, it's likely best to do two separate procedures. Fat transfer to your bottom requires that you lie face down during their recovery period to take pressure off of the fragile fat. A tummy tuck procedure, which is performed during a mommy makeover, will make it difficult to lie face down. I would recommend liposuction and fat transfer to the buttocks first, allow time to recover, and then have a mommy makeover during a separate second procedure.","Austin Hayes, MD answers: Is a BBL included in a mommy makeover?

My lower body does not include the inner thigh lift, breast lift (mastopexy), or arm reduction (brachioplasty). The cost for a lower body lift is highly variable. The cost for a lower body lift depends on many factors. One factor is your chosen plastic surgeon's experience. Usually, the more experienced plastic surgeonscharge more because the body lift procedureis their specialty. Another factor is geography. The more expensive the practice location, the more the body lift costs. This has to do with overhead, like malpractice insurance, office rent, and staff, etc.Therefore, a body lift will probably cost more in a busy,metropolitan city than a rural town. Another costfactoris where the body lift surgery will be performed. Usually, if the body lift is performed in a hospital the costs are higher.  However, this may be off set by partial or complete insurance coverage for the body lift. Usually, if the body lift is performed in a surgery center, the costs are lower. Also, the length of body liftsurgery may affect the cost of the body lift. If your body lift is performed in four hours, your cost may be lower than if your body lift takes ten hours to perform. The hourly deferentialreally depends how your plastic surgeon structures his/her pricing. I specialize in plastic surgery after massive weight loss. In my practice, Ido not charge by the amount weight lost or the amount of skin that Iremove. To determine the costs of a lower body lift, RealSelf has done an excellent job.

Too much pressure can reduce blood flow in the tiny blood vessels in the skin which may lead to poor healing.Typically, there will be an initial period of continuous abdominal compression garment around the clock for the 2 weeks then just at night for the second and third&nbsp;weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be helpful to have some form of compression for the first 2-3 months to reduce overall chances of swelling and expedite your healing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the compression is to aid in allowing the new flat tummy skin to sculpt and fit to your torso without excess swelling, fluid accumulation and to offer some support as your repaired&nbsp;muscles become well&nbsp;adjusted.

	A tummy tuck is a big surgery and involves manipulation of not only fat and skin that gets removed, but also involves tightening of the abdominal muscles that are involved in your core- muscles that you use every day in nearly every movement. &nbsp;While you should not be afraid of recovery after an abdominoplasty, don't underestimate it either.

	I usually tell my patients to expect that the first few days after the operation will be the hardest, and you should expect to have a good support system from family for the first week while you gradually increase your activity. &nbsp;By the second week, you should be getting around nicely on your own, though you will still find yourself more tired than usual as your body uses energy to heal from the surgery. &nbsp;Motions involving your core such as stretching or twisting will still create some tenderness at this point, but you are well on your way to healing. &nbsp;Weeks 3 and 4 see further comfort with increasing activity.

	Gradual improvement follows and it will take several moths to completely feel normal again. &nbsp;I don't like my patients to do anything that will make them sweat for the first 3-4 weeks after surgery, and though you can shower soon after surgery, I don't want my patients submerging into a hot tub or pool or ocean for at least a month after their tummy tuck operation.

	As for postoperative visits, I see all of my patients the day after surgery, once or twice the week after surgery, the following week, and then begin to space visits back to the office depending on the patient's schedule and convenience. I have not seen a lot of emotional mood swings following tummy tucks, but I do think that patients should overestimate their recovery so you don't do too much too soon and jeopardize your result or general well being.

	Mommy makeover surgery is a very common combination procedure though it does come with a longer recovery than just one of the procedures separately and there is a higher risk of complications because of the length of procedure. I would recommend you to be at your best for surgery by increasing your protein intake 3 weeks in advance and stopping any hormone therapy 3 weeks in advance. These two preoperative suggestions will increase your healing capacity and decrease your risk of blod clots. I always have my tummy tucks stay overnight to make sure you are comfortable and able to ambulate the night of the operation with assistance. I do inject local anesthetic both in the breast and the abdomen which does help with early mobility and I treat nausea before it starts. By definition, mommy makeovers are done on moms with young families, so have some help at home. You will feel okay after one week and after 3 to 4 be able to return to cardio workouts. I usually have you refrain form heavy lifting for 6 weeks which includes children for 6 weeks. If you are preparing for the worst experience of your life it likely will. Make sure you discuss these points with your board certified plastic surgeon.

12353032,question,,"Thank you for your question regarding whether you need a full tummy tuck; let's examine the different types of tummy tucks. A full tummy tuck would require an incision, dissection to the sternum, muscle plication, mons lift, and removal of excess skin from the pubic region to above the belly button. This surgery would also include belly button reconstruction. Anything short of that is not a full tummy tuck. During a mini tummy tuck, sometimes muscle plication is performed. However, it is unlikely to be performed up to the sternum. During the mini tummy tuck, only a minimal amount of skin is removed from the pubic region up to the belly buttonhybrids of full tummy tuck to the mini tummy tuck range in spectrum from the procedures mentioned above. Therefore, if you want muscle plication, you need some form of a tummy tuck, whether it's a minimum or complete tummy tuck. In my opinion, you would achieve the best results with a full tummy tuck with muscle plication, pubic lift, pubic reduction, elimination of excess skin and fat to the pubic region to the belly button, and umbilical reconstruction. That would yield your best results.You will compromise your results if you cannot live with a tummy tuck scar. If you want a shorter scar, the results from your tummy tuck may not be as optimal. Another option to consider if you do not want a tummy tuck scar would be to undergo VASER Hi-Def Liposuction with Morpheus8 treatment. During VASER Hi-Def Liposuction with Morpheus8 excess abdominal fat Is removed. The VASER heats the skin from underneath, and the Morpheus8 maximizes skin contractility. This would avoid a tummy tuck incision, but it would not also eliminate skin and would not repair the muscle. However, the benefit of the VASER and Morpheus8 is there would be no tummy tuck scar. The choice is really up to you. I hope this helps answer your question regarding whether you need a full tummy tuck. VASERhi def abdominal sculpting or etching is a technically difficult procedure. Your plasticsurgeon must know his abdominal wall anatomy. When seeking revision VASERhi def abdominal etching,please seek an experienced, board certified plastic surgeonwith significant experience performing the VASER hi def procedure.

Yes, based on your information and photos, you are a candidate for a full tummy tuck. Most candidates for a tummy tuck typically have excess abdominal skin, excess fat, and weak abdominal muscles. In your case, you have a mild amount of excess skin, a moderate amount of fat, but significant rectus abdominis muscle weakness.Given these factors, you would likely benefit most from a full tummy tuck. During the procedure, an incision will be made from hip to hip, placed beneath your prior C-section scar. The surgeon will then perform a dissection up to your sternum, repair the rectus abdominis muscle from the sternum to the pubic region with permanent sutures, and remove the lower abdominal skin and fat. Additionally, your mons or pubic region will be raised and reduced, and your belly button will be relocated.Since you do not have a large amount of lower abdominal skin, only a limited amount of this skin may be removed, which could result in a small vertical scar where your original belly button was located. However, this scar usually heals well. Most plastic surgeons would agree that a full tummy tuck is the best option for you, especially given your muscle weakness and desire for comprehensive results.Please plan for a recovery period of 2 to 3 weeks after surgery, which typically takes about 3 to 4 hours under general anesthesia.Good luck, and I hope this helps answer your question regarding whether you have enough skin for a full tummy tuck.Sincerely,J.

Your pictures seems to demonstrate that you have fullness and laxity in the mons region, as well as some mild fullness and laxity in the lower abdominal soft tissues as weYou have several options, but your best options will include some type of skin excision, probably along with some liposuction. Liposuction alone will reduce the excess fat, but will likely leave you with loose tissue that may droop or sag even further. Although excising the excess loose tissue will leave a scar, you are somewhat used to that because you have had two cesarean sections. The scar will be longer, but the benefit is that you will have a much more even and smoother contour with tighter skin in this area.  The cost of this procedure, will ultimately depend upon exactly what is done. A full-time tummy tuck is obviously more expensive than a mini tummy tuck.

Many of our patients are encouraged to take 1 -2 weeks off from work or get help at home for those that are stay home moms.However, your best plastic surgeon has the experience,training, and results that relates to you. Do your research and find a realPlastic Surgeon and book a paid consultation. Free consults are just a salespitch and does not work in your best interest. People always say you get whatyou pay for. This is very true in Plastic Surgery. Below are other criteria to use when selecting a Plastic surgeon.Questions to ask your potential plastic surgeon (Answering NO is a big redflag)1) Are you a plastic surgeon? (You should research the differences betweencosmetic surgeon & plastic surgeon. Make sure that your plastic surgeon isa trained surgeon! You may be surprised)2) Are you board certified in Plastic Surgery? (Board certified in what? Youare looking for the American Board of Plastic Surgery. There are many boardsand some are fake. Make sure that the certifying board is a member board of theAmerican Board of Medical Specialties or the American Osteopathic Association.)3) Will the procedure be performed at a fully accredited & certified procedureroom or ambulatory surgery center, or hospital4) Do you have hospital privilege to perform the same procedure you do in theoffice? Which Hospital?5) Do you offer complication insurance. How do you handle complications andrevision (it does happen, it better to be safe)The most important decision is to do your homework well. Good luck.","Stanley Okoro, MD answers: Mommy Makeover Recovery Time",/question/recovery-tummy-tuck-breast-augmentation

	The variety of Fraxel lasers (such as the Re:Store, Dual, and Re:Pair) along with the other fractional resurfacing lasers (such as the Palomar Artisan, ActiveFX&nbsp;and others) are wonderful tools in the strategy to minimize scarring, whether these scars are old or new.

	Although there are treatments for scars of all ages, I believe getting&nbsp;to scars earlier than later can be of benefit in many cases,&nbsp;as I feel we can affect the way new collagen and scars form in a positive way.&nbsp; In fact, when I perform Mohs micrographic surgery for the treatment of skin cancer, I will often employ a variety of lasers to reduce any scar appearance during the initial routine follow-up visits.&nbsp; Of course, each situation is different and must be individually evaluated.&nbsp; However, if scars begin to show evidence of uneven textures (either thickening or thinning), the use of ablative (i.e. superficially wounding)&nbsp;fractional lasers (such as the Fraxel Re:Pair) in the near term (i.e. first 1-2 months) can be very valuable.&nbsp; When the developing scars show evidence of just slight uneven&nbsp;texture, the non-ablative (non-wounding) fractional resurfacing lasers are often valuable.&nbsp; If scar redness is prominent, the pulsed dye laser (such as the Candela VBeam laser) can also be integrated at the same time.&nbsp; When broken blood vessels become evident, other vascular lasers can be employed to augment the pulsed dye laser therapy, such as the Gemini laser.&nbsp; These lasers, in combination with&nbsp;injecting a variety of medications can also help minimize the appearance of scars.&nbsp; I will often consider injecting steroids (such as Kenalog) and 5 fluorouracil depending on the situation.

	I realize there is a lot of information out there, but the good news is that scars can be markedly improved and its valuable to consider the entire arsenal of tools out there and even a combination approach.&nbsp; To summarize the question that prompted this discussion: yes, Fraxel lasers are a very valuable component in the treatment of new scars, but consider all the options and combination therapies that are available.

10549964,question,,"you really need liposuction + skinremoval (tummy tuck) to really get a good result. if you have loose skin, liposuction alone of the mons pubis (see my youtube)  will make you smaller but looser.my whole practice is doing lipoabdominoplasty, or at least liposuction with internal heating (which is not the gold standard for skin tightening with body contouring).the smaller you are before liposuction the more contouring you can get from the procedure. most of my liposuction patients get pre and post surgical optimization with hormonal therapy (see link to help boost their weight loss before surgery and help them heal after).You need a formal evaluation by an expert in body shaping and contouring to determine what is best. Traditional liposuction awake and smart liposuction are old methods and do very poorly for tightening skin or significant skin tightening or contouring. Small problem areas can be improved slightly by these methods. The best in body contouring not only removes fat with energy devices like VASERultrasound but also internally heat the skin with radio-frequency devices such as J PLASMA/RENUVION, InMode BodyTite, ThermiRF to heat the under surface of the skin and tighten it at the same time as fat removal. These combinations are called 4D HIDEFVASERcontouring and can only be done by a well . trained body contouring specialist. At the same time fat should be harvested, PRP and stem cells added and injected into muscles or indentations/cellulite to get body shaping and contouring. This is known as a Brazilian butt lift when you inject the fat to the buttock for contouring and lifting, but fat can also be used in areas such as the chest/breast, arms/shoulders, calves and face. Cellulite should also be treated with cellfina, sculptra, subcision and/or fillers such as bellafill, renuva synthetic fat, or sculptra. If skin is very loose before surgery then it will need to be removed such as lower abdominal skin (tummy tuck/abdominoplasty), breast skin (breast lift), arm skin (brachioplasty). Overall you need a full assessment, but simple liposuction alone will not tighten skin and needs a combination of various methods -- fat removal, skin tightening, defining, fat grafting, skin removal -- to get the best in body contouring and body sculpting.

4671255,question,,"OMG, I didn't realize the human body was that flexible! &nbsp;What a great question.&nbsp; I personally have never run into this situation with such flexibility along with a surgery that, if done correctly, gives a great deal of tightness both of muscle and skin.&nbsp; It would seem to me that your flexibility comes from both your vertebrae, your ribs, and probably other bony and muscle interactions such as hips.&nbsp; I don't understand your area but I certainly do mine.In a well done abdominoplasty, the correction of the rectus diastasis is done with suture that is replaced by scar tissue within 3 months.&nbsp; Once this scar tissue has matured, it may not be quite as pliable and distendable as the muscle itself.&nbsp; Also, the skin of the abdomen is normally connected to the skin of the anterior thigh and the remnant of the mons pubis by scar which acts as an anchor to hold the anterior thigh skin up and the abdominal skin pulled in a downward direction. &nbsp;Certainly, you understand that skin stretches since you had one or more pregnancies, and your abdominal skin adapted to the forces placed on it by the uterus by stretching out.&nbsp; Muscles also adapt to forces placed on them.&nbsp; Therefore, I believe your abdominoplasty, if given sufficient time to heal and mature, should allow you to regain most if not all of your flexibility since the flexibility actually came from the skeletal connections and not soft tissue. &nbsp;Obviously, I am way out on a limb here but I believe the same determination that allowed you to be such an incredibly flexible person, along with the skill and experience of your Board Certified plastic surgeon working together after surgery and during your recovery and post recovery periods should allow you to regain almost all, if not all, of your flexibility and having a great looking abdomen to boot.","S.

5546283,question,,"First of all, thank you for asking these questions and sharing photos to reference. &nbsp;There are TONS of moms out there with the same issues that you present, and your questions and discussion of your photos will help so many others as well. &nbsp;When it come to your breasts, I would recommend an augmentation mastopexy (breast implants with a lift). &nbsp;That will give you a more full upper pole of the breast as well as tighten up the remaining breast tissue/skin.As for your abdomen, I&nbsp;get this question of tummy tuck vs liposuction&nbsp;frequently. &nbsp;It is really your decision to make, but you should be informed before surgery of the outcome to each procedure.&nbsp;A tummy tuck with liposuction to the flanks (the procedure I&nbsp;would recommend in your case) allows removal of an ellipse-shaped piece of tissue from around the top of the pubic hairline to just above the belly button as well as bringing&nbsp;the six pack muscles back together at the midline&nbsp;which we call a fascial plication. &nbsp;In exchange for removing all of that tissue, bringing your abdominal muscles back together,&nbsp;and REALLY being able to flatten out the abdomen, you are then left with a horizontal scar from roughly hip bone to hip bone which is essentially covered by most underwear. &nbsp;Add liposuction to the love handles, and you get a great shape. &nbsp;If you absolutely&nbsp;do not want the horizontal scar, liposuction alone will certainly improve your overall shape, but it can cause contour irregularities or asymmetries when done too aggressively. &nbsp;Best of luck to you.","M.

9888119,question,,"You've asked an excellent questionabout a number of measures that can be taken to lessen risks and improve the overall patient experience with surgery. For the longest time, and in some instances still to this day, surgeons have been tunnel vision focused on their surgical plan, and the overall management of patientswas either overlooked or simply deferred to the anesthesiologists.With the advent of a new mindset in surgery known as ERAS,or Enhanced RecoveryAfter Surgery, this is all changing.In a nutshell, ERAS is a concept that originated first in Scandinavia with colorectal surgeons trying to decrease risks in surgical patients and expedite recovery and hosptial discharge, thenmade its way to the UK, and now has been increasingly used bysurgeons in the US and Canada with great success in all different surgicalspecialties, including plastic surgery. The general concept of ERAS is one of detailed analysis of all processes before, during, and after surgery which affect surgical outcome, risk, patient comfort, and the like, in an effortto develop a list of best practices, or those things which should be done routinely to optimize the overall experience for our patients.Things like urinary catheters and preoperative beverages fall into this category. For nearly the past 10 years,I have beenfortunate to work with an anesthesiogist who has been at the leading edge of the ERASmovement internationally, and in fact shepatented and manufactures the first specially formulated preoperative beverage in the world, which I'll mention momentarily.Ihave learned so much from her, and I can proudly say that I have had an ERASpractice nowfor nearly a decade, and it really works - the things you are talking about in your question ARE important and they DOaffect outcomes.As far as urinary catheters go, much of the decision around that specific measurewill depend upon the type andduration of the surgery and the amount of intravenousfluid the anesthesiolgist anticipates giving during surgery.Usually from the standpoint of an ERAS practice, the anesthesiolgists will run patients on the dry side, meaning they willgive minimal amounts of fluid during surgery, and this will keep urine output on the lower side, which in turnwill keep the bladder from distending, and this will help with things like postoperative pain and nausea. In shorter cases, we wouldn't use a catheter because we wouldn't really need it to protect the bladder andthen the risk of possible urinary infection or urethral or bladder irritation are eliminated.In my practice if we anticipate a case to extend beyond about 4 hours, or involve abdominal wall surgery, like a tummy tuck, we will most certainly use a catheter.We put the catheter in once our patient is asleep in the OR and usually take it out before they wake up, especially for breast-only surgery.In the case of a body procedure, like tummy tuck or body lift, we might send our patients home with their catheter and remove it the next day.With regard to your question about drinking waterpreoperatively, since studies show that the stomach is emptied of clear liquids after about 2 hours, we now believe it is safe to drink clear liquids, including water, up to 2 hours before the time of surgery. The main risk of drinking anything other than clear liquids, or eating anything solid, is that the stomach may not be empty when going to sleep under anesthesia, and the patient can vomit and aspirate stomach contents into their lungs. While water may be OK, it's not really the best beverage though.Many studies have also shown that a special type of carbohydrate additivein a clear beverage, in addition to some electrolytes and certain minerals and other components, is superior to water alone.This will provide not only hydration for the body and keep you from being thirsty, but the carbohydrate also provides energy for the brain and heart, and this decreases things like anxiety, pain, and glucose intolerance. The beverage like this that Imentioned before is ClearFast, and I have been using that one for my patients for almost 10 years. It's amazing how much a simple little intervention like this improves so many aspects of risk and overall patient experience. There are many, many other measures that a true ERAS approach will also include for each kind of surgery, and if you are interested in finding out if your surgeon uses an ERAS approach, you should ask them about it and discuss what measures their approachincludes. Always choose a board certified plastic surgeon for your surgery, as this is one of the best ways to assure that your surgeon will have the best training and experience to provide the safest care and achieve the best overall outcome. In addition to being certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, the only generally recognized organization which certifies true plastic surgeons and has the term Plastic Surgery in its title, your surgeon should also participate in the Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program administered by that board. This program requires that surgeons who participate continue to update their credentials and professional standing regularly, as opposed to practicing on a single lifetime certificate like those plastic surgeons who received their certificates prior to 1995 and voluntarily elect not to participate. To find further information about this program and any surgeons you might consider for your surgery, I suggest visiting these sites: abplsurg.org and abms.org. Good luck.","Joseph L.

12515642,question,,"To make an assessment on the outcome of a procedure we add at your minimum need to see quality before and after pictures.If you dont have proper before and after pictures then ask your surgeon to forward the ones he or she took.Each surgeon has grown way of designing Asian. Overall your results look typical or slightly above average.The hallmarks have a quality tummy tuck are usually a natural appearing belly button and central abdominal With a very low sad scar that follows an atomic contours naturally. The scars should be even on both sides and the final shape of the torso should be attractive balanced and appropriate from all angles including from behind.Most plastic surgeons one that turned patients on their side or face down during a tummy tuck. this makes shaping the torso in the waist and love handles difficult and results are generally not as good as when Liposuction is done as a solo procedure.There are also inherent safety reasons plastic surgeons may be apprehensive to do aggressive liposuction in conjunction with a tummy tuck.Having both Liposuction and a tummy tuck is in fact having two procedures done at the same time.Patient considering having multiple procedures should vet providers adequately in regards to skill and experience for both procedures.I typically recommend patients ask providers to show their entire collection before and after pictures during in person consultations.An experience provider should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures during a consultation.If the surgeon recommends liposuction then you should specifically ask to see lots of before and after pictures of their liposuction results.If youre having a tummy tuck then you should likewise ask to see as many before and after pictures as possible especially of previous patients who had similar body characteristics to your owner.Do your results look similar to the before and after pictures you were shown during the consultation?Did you have multiple in person consultations preparing results among different surgeons choosing the best one?Getting back to your outcome.Im guessing that your plastic surgeon wanted to give you a very low set scar and in doing so was unable to remove all the skin of your lower abdomen including the incision around your belly button.When thats the case a small vertical scar is created between the new belly button position and the primary incision. This helps at least in part explain the vertical fold or line of your lower abdomen. Its pretty common for plastic surgeons to do aggressive liposuction in a straight line along the midline above the belly button up to the rib cage to mimic showing muscle definition of the midline of the abdomen. This anatomic structure is called the linea alba. I would say most plastic surgeons try to emphasize and contour a vertical line from the belly button to the sternum. On young attractive bodybuilding type bodies usually there is a visible midline structure from the belly button to the sternum. That usually does not continue below the belly button. Its possible your plastic surgeon continued liposuction in that same vertical line above and below your belly button. What does your surgeon have to say about the outcome?Personally my preference on designing a tummy tuck scar is to make the incision slightly convex over the mons pubis then follow in the groin crease. This creates a full-wing type appearance. Others like in your case maintain a concave incision through the mons pubis. Personally I believe the natural curvature of the mons pubis is the other way around. (like the top of the clock from the 10 oclock to 2 oclock position).Most plastic surgeons stay consistent with their tummy tuck incision designs and this shouldve been discussed and reviewed during the consultation when you had a chance at reviewing before and after pictures.A tummy tuck is a fairly permanent and irreversible operation.Once created its difficult to make significant improvements through revisions.The time to be critical about results is during the vetting process when you are comparing the results of various plastic surgeons in the process of choosing the best provider.My best guess is that your result is fairly typical for your provider.Delivering consistent quality liposuction results is more difficult than most people believe.Most plastic surgeons are not particularly good at Liposuction.Most plastic surgeons however claim to be at least competent if not good to excellent at doing liposuction.In reality delivering consistent quality liposuction results that are predictable based on reviewing before and after pictures of previous patients with similar body characteristics who had quality outcomes is actually quite rare.Far too many plastic surgeons believe that Liposuction is a simplistic procedure with a low learning curve. They go through the motions of removing fat because its included and theyre charging for it but do not really put much emphasis in that part of the procedure since the tummy tuck is what theyre there for. Liposuction results has more variation in outcome based on who does the procedure than any other plastic surgery operation Ive ever seen.There are plenty of board-certified plastic surgeons with overall good reputations who have years of experience who cannot deliver quality liposuction results on a regular basis.That is not to say there are not lots of plastic surgeons who are really good at liposuction.It is simply a procedure who is outcome varies greatly based on who does the operation.The skill, experience and especially attitude towards liposuction varies greatly from surgeon to surgeon.A fair number of plastic surgeons simply dont like doing liposuction.I suggest you follow up with your provider and discuss your concerns with him or her. While there you should also ask to get all copies of your before and after pictures so you can use those in the future if you want to get an assessment of your outcome.In order to make an assessment on the results of a procedure we absolutely have to know what you look like before surgery.Sometimes people who are unhappy with tummy tuck results should spend more time looking at their before pictures.It is a very big operation and it will inevitably leave some small areas that come out a little different than anticipated.It is not an operation that should be redone or revised unless absolutely necessary unless there are obvious flaws.Its not possible to give you a good assessment of why you have the fold or skin line of your lower abdomen.Part of it is for sure related to closing the incision around your belly button in order to set the scar low.Had to design been reversed with a convex approach over the mons pubis it may have been able to incorporate that part of the lower abdominal skin as part of the procedure. its easy to play Monday morning quarterback. Overall your outcome looks at least average to above average from what I see being posted on this website.The incision is even and set very low. Your belly button looks better than most. Overall I would say it looks like very competent work.Its simply difficult to address the vertical line of your lower abdomen without an examination or having been present during surgeryBest,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Over 1 year post op - Unhappy about results.

75645,question,,"There are many methods available and each surgeon will have their own routine and preferences. Generally, however, the immediate breast implants recovery period is only about 2-3 days for most patients before you return to your daily activities and have minimal need for pain medication. There are pain pumps available that use local anaesthetic, some surgeons inject local anaesthetic into the surgical site, some use anti-inflammatory medications and/or muscle relaxers as well as the usual narcotic pain medication. The two most important factors, however, are choosing the correct implant size and meticulous dissection at the time of surgery. The bigger the implant, the more discomfort you will have due to increased stretching of your tissues. During surgery the less the tissues are traumatized and the less bleeding there is, the better your postop pain level will be. Going under the muscle has somewhat more discomfort but not a significant difference that I have noticed.  Moms who have been through childbirth and breast engorgement tend to recover faster than patients who have not had children yet. Overall, the pain level is very well managed and lasts for only a short period of time.  Pain levels are very subjective and each patient is different and needs different methods of pain control that works best for them - so review your pain tolerance with your surgeon and choose from the different techniques available that suits you best. The most important factor is your breast implant size compared to your body type and tissue characteristics.","Bahram Ghaderi, MD answers: How can the pain and recovery time after getting breast implants be minimized?",/question/how-can-pain-recovery-time-after-getting-breast-implants-be-minimized

	The cost of a tummy tuck varies not only from city to city, but from person to person.&nbsp; There are many types of tummy tucks and the fees vary based on the length of the surgery.&nbsp; In Omaha, Nebraska @ our office the fee varies from $5,000-$8,000.&nbsp; This fee includes the folowing:

	
		Pre-operative consultation and photographs with analysis
	
		Surgeon&#39;s professional fee
	
		Anesthesia fee
	
		Operating suite fee
	
		All post operative garments
	
		All post operative office visits and photographs
	
		Ten (10) post operative sessions on our Endermologie machine to improve the results
	
		No charge for any touch up procedure if needed


	The componets of a tummy tuck include the following:

	
		Skin removal from abdomen (hips and back if needed)
	
		Fat removal from abdomen, hips and back
	
		Muscle tightening of the Rectus Abdominis muscles
	
		Umbilical hernia repair, if needed
	
		Contouring of the Mons Pubis


	A tummy tuck is a major operation, comparable to a C-Section or a Hysterectomy.&nbsp; It should be undertaken only under ideal circumstances in healthy, non-smoking individuals who are finished with child bearing.&nbsp; It is meant to be a permanent correction of the contour of the abdomen, therefore no pregnancies should occur after the procedure.&nbsp; This can usually&nbsp;be performed as an outpatient in our Ambulatory Surgery Center located in our office.

	There are many different modalities to treat&nbsp;the abdominal pouch, not all involve surgery.&nbsp; A tummy tuck is the Cadillac of the procedures, here is a list of the options:

	
		Lower Body Lift
	
		Circumferential Abdominoplasty
	
		Extended Abdominoplasty
	
		Full Abdomioplasty
	
		Modified Abdominoplasty
	
		Mini-Abdominoplasty
	
		Abdominoplasty with Umbilical Float
	
		Abdominoplasty with T-Closure
	
		Lipoplasty
	
		CoolSculpting
	
		Endermologie (LPG)


	The decision on what procedure to perform is based on the patient&#39;s expectations, the surgeon&#39;s evaluation, cost, time off of work, the patient&#39;s health, previous abdominal scars, smoking history and the desire for future pregnancy.&nbsp; An in depth consultation with a board certified Plastic Surgeon experienced in body contouring surgeries is recommended.&nbsp; Sometimes a combination of the above listed procedures is needed.

8022173,question,,"Hello and thank you for your question and your pictures.Although you would be best served with an exam in person, from your photographs alone it appears that you&nbsp;have a great deal of loose skin that will not shrink even with more exercise and diet. You are a great candidate for a tummy tuck with some body contouring using liposuction.&nbsp;Pregnancy oftentimes will leave a woman with stretched out abdominal muscles that do not recover their pre-pregnancy state. Any resulting bulging appearance of the belly will not be fixed with exercise only but can only be adequately addressed with plication (tightening) of the muscles, which is performed during a tummy tuck. Your hernia can also be repaired at the same time.There are several ways to do a tummy tuck and it&nbsp;varies from plastic surgeon to plastic surgeon on how they perform the procedure.&nbsp;When I&nbsp;perform a tummy tuck&nbsp;I&nbsp;do not&nbsp;use drains&nbsp;and I have been extremely happy with the results. I use a technique called progressive tension sutures in which the sutures hold the abdominal skin in place and minimize the space for any fluid to collect.&nbsp;The no drain tummy tuck makes recovery much easier for my patients. Without the drains, patients are able to walk after surgery without the worry of the drains being pulled on and it avoids any pain or discomfort associated with the drains at&nbsp;the skin where they exit. Another technique I use during my tummy tucks is injection of Exparel,&nbsp;which is a long lasting local anesthetic that I&nbsp;place along the muscles that are tightened to help with pain relief during the recovery process.Be sure to seek a consultation with a board-eligible or board-certified plastic surgeon who specializes in aesthetic plastic surgery and be sure they address all your concerns including the risks and benefits of the procedures, recovery time and postoperative course.&nbsp;I believe a key component of the consultation is to establish a good connection with your plastic surgeon. If you dont feel you have a good connection after your consultation then they may not be the best surgeon for you.&nbsp;Good luck!Olivier A.

72170,question,,"Hello BarbiebiondaThe best guide to what your breasts could look like after surgery is what they look like before surgery. So you are correct in identifying your breast and body type as similar to Carmen Electra (although I am not sure I know what her breasts actually looked like without a bra).What we see in magazines, movies, and commercials is not necessarily what that celebrity looks like with their clothes off.  Most celebrities have the advantage of personal assistants who tan them, dress them, tape them, and squeeze them into Spanx.There was an article in CNN.com about a year ago that &quot;revealed&quot; Hollywood secrets. One of the worst kept secrets in Hollywood is tape!  Yes, good old fashioned tape can prop up breasts, give them cleavage, bring them together and make them look very different for those red carpet moments.Be very clear about what you like when you have a consultation with your surgeon. In our office, we see many different types of patients: moms who have lost breast volume and just want to be filled up, young women who want a very full look, models who have portfolios, etc.  Each one of those women will have preferences that lead me to recommend a different size and type of implant for each.Clear goals are most important, but so are reasonable expectations.

9727766,question,,"The difference between higher and lower profiles for a given volume is projection and for a given width is volume (with the high profile implant being greater in both scenarios). Themoderate plus is the most commonly usedprofile in my practice. Itallowsfor the most reasonable volume in a given BWD. In my practice, low profile implants are the least commonly used (widest and flattest).I will typically reserve high profile devices for smaller framed individuals or those seeking a less subtle more dramatic change (the opposite of natural).In general, the difference between a highand Mod (+), in reality, is very small (on the order of millimeters). In my practice,I generally classify profile based upon patient preference. A higher profile provides a more dramatic look (size for size) vs. a moderate (+) profile which is relatively more subtle and understated. That being said the vast majority of patients will select a moderate + profile device (especially those seeking a more natural and subtle result).I often find it is easier to decide on a profile (rather than a volume), this combined with BWD will determine volume. Trying to match a particular volume to a profile may lead a BWD mismatch.In my practice, smaller framed individuals do prefer higher profile devices. Ultimately, profile choiceis a choice between more or less subtlety (moderate profile natural; high profile dramatic)With regards to your specific question, there is always a compromise. If you are seeking a natural, less dramatic change, a low profilemay be more appropriate (despite the low demand in my practice). That being said, subglandular (overs) tend to have a less natural upper pole than comparative submuscular (unders) implants.As always, discuss your concerns with a board certified plastic surgeon (ABPS).Donovan Rosas MDBoard Certified by theAmerican Board of Plastic SurgeryMember: American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery,American Society of Plastic SurgeonsRealSelf Verified MemberRealSelf Top 100RealSelf Hall of Fame","Donovan Rosas, MD answers: Are low profile saline implants over the muscle too noticeable?",/question/houston-tx-profile-saline-implants-muscle-noticeable
1976760,question,,"Any disorder of the normal blood clotting mechanism can cause an increased risk of excessive bleeding, which may be an acceptable risk for necessary surgery, but less acceptable for elective cosmetic surgery. And, of course, if bleeding DOES occur, you would expect your surgeon to step up and deal with the problem, which may involve additional surgery to drain a hematoma,&nbsp; cauterize bleeders, or deal with loss of adequate circulation leading to dead tissue and/or skin. Your dead skin, both your surgeon's and your headache!That being said, type I von Willebrand disease is both common and variable in its bleeding risk. von Willebrand patients may also have Factor VIII deficiency (classic hemophilia). so hematology work-up is essential, particularly before considering larger procedures such as brachioplasty or tummy tuck, where skin flaps are raised and adequate circulation is a concern (along with bleeding or excessive bruising that can lead to ischemia and dead skin).With appropriate Hematology work-up and successful clearance for other medical concerns/health risks, there are many plastic surgeons who will be happy to discuss your requests and assess your risks. Then you both can decide together.One final concern is about fat grafting for breast augmentation. In general I do not recommend this, despite some of my colleagues who think it is just fine. I think all of us would agree that some of the injected fat dies (though the percentages vary widely depending on which side of the issue you fall on), and this can range from 20-60%, depending on whom you read or talk to. BTW, this leaves only 30-80% of the fat that survives, and visible breast enlargement without creating blobs of dead fat, scar fibrosis, and microcalcifications that can interfere with the detection of breast cancer via mammogram is IMHO a dicey proposition. I would not want to risk my patients' lives that these are no problem, mon.

	Regarding: &quot;Resulting Scar, No Belly Button and Wrinkles After Umbilical Hernia Repair
	i had an umbilical hernia repair 6 months after giving birth in 2003, i was 18 at the time, the general surgeon that performed my surgery did not mention anything about loosing my belly button including getting wrinkles prior to surgery. nothing was discussed instead after the surgery, she informed me suprisingly that my belly button will be reconstructed, she never followed up with me so here i am 8 years later still trying to figure out how i will fix this problem.i am 26, 5&#39;5 and weigh 127lbs&quot;

	Sorry about your situation but it IS fixable.

	Loss of the belly button is a well known complication of umbilical hernia repairs and MUCH more so with repair of recurrent umbilical hernias. I am not sure why you were not told about it. (Possibly in an attempt not to scare you). The blood vessels keeping the belly button alive run on the side walls and in the fat right around the tube making up the belly button. The SAME location where the hernia sac is located. In the process of separating the hernia sac from the belly button stalk some of these vessels are injured. If enough of them are injured, the belly button may not get enough blood and will die which is what happened to you.

	If you are at your ideal weight or a BMI of 28 and under, are done having children and are ready for it, a Full Tummy Tuck can be done which would not only flatten your tummy, narrow the waist, removing a lot of the stretch mark damaged skin under the belly button and lift a sagging Mons pubis but it COULD be combined with creation of a NEW belly button for you.

	I just answered your question about having a Brazilian Butt Lift first. Educate yourself on all your options and you will do well.

Non-smokers will do better than smokers. Overweightpeople will not do as well as slim people.I perform most of my liposuction and fat transfer without the use of general anesthesia.An abdominoplasty does however always require general anesthesia.I cannot imagine someone doing all that surgery in three hours and doing it well.Even six hours it's short if those procedures are to be done well.It's like anything else if you want to do it right then it's going to take time.I can mow my lawn and pick up things in the yard in half an hour.To make my yard look really good it takes several hours.I can liposuction out some fat and graft it in 20 minutes.Meticulous liposuction can take several hours by itself.Sometimes I spend half an hour just redoing the bellybutton.Have you ever seen those abdominoplasty results where the bellybutton looks really bad or ones where the bellybutton looks completely natural.My guess is the ones that look bad probably did not take very long.In my opinion the preferred order is to perform liposuction with the Brazilian first using local anesthesia and mild sedation.Six months later have the patient undergo a full abdominoplasty using general anesthesia.There are usually enough cost savings by avoiding hours of general anesthesia time that the surgery becomes no more expensive by splitting it into two procedures.Direct cover you for an abdominoplasty or Brazilian it's hard.The recovery from a combined abdominoplasty Brazilian is brutal.if it was for me or someone in my family I would say slow down and do it into procedures.most plastic surgeons will not perform aggressive liposuction in conjunction with an abdominoplasty in order to minimize complications.When done as two separate procedures liposuction can be done as aggressively as needed to get the best contour.,"Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Is it safe to have a TT, Lipo and BBL all at once?",/question/silver-spring-md-safe-tt-lipo-bbl

Some will get back to work albeit with some difficulty after only one week, but it is possible.Two weeks off is better though in general.

	Anxiety you are experiencing prior to surgery is quite common. Many moms have great concerns about undergoing elective plastic surgery and worry about returning safely to their families. &nbsp;Many patients experience feelings of anxiety and/or guilt prior to the procedures.

	Although every operation does carry risk, the &nbsp;risk of major or fatal, conditions are &nbsp;relatively small assuming that you are in good health, your procedures are being done by a well experienced board-certified plastic surgeon, the anesthesiology is provided by a well-trained/experienced individual, the procedure is &nbsp;being performed in a fully accredited facility, and aftercare is handled correctly.

	&nbsp;Given the degree of anxiety, you may do well by meeting with your plastic surgeon again prior to surgery. Address specific questions/concerns.

	&nbsp;You may find the following words of advice I give my patients helpful to you:

	1. Make sure you are doing the procedure for the right reasons (for yourself)&nbsp; and that you have realistic expectations.&nbsp; Be aware that an improvement in the problem area may not translate to an overall improvement in your life&nbsp;&nbsp; situation.&nbsp; You are bound to be disappointed with results of the procedure if your motivation for doing the surgery is not internally driven.
	2. Time your surgery carefully; generally, it is not a good idea to have surgery done during or immediately after a stressful period in life (for example divorce or death of a loved one). The additional stress of surgery will undoubtedly be&nbsp; more challenging to deal with if a patient's emotional reserves our already exhausted. Remember, that an improvement in your physical appearance will not translate to an improvement in your life situation.
	3. If possible speak to patients who have undergone similar procedures and query them about the toughest times of their recovery period. Any practical hints previous patients can provide may be very helpful.
	4. Make sure you are aware of potential complications that may arise how to reach your surgeon if necessary.

	5. Make sure you have a strong and patient support system (several people if possible) in place who have time/patience to take care of you. Arrange for professional nursing if any doubt exists regarding the availability and/or stamina&nbsp; of your caretakers.
	6. Be patient with the healing process, understanding that it will take several weeks to months to feel normal again. It may also take many months/year to see the end results of your surgery.
	7. Be prepared to distract your mind with things of interest such as books, magazines, and movies.
	8. Expect less of yourself; do not go back to work, school or chores too early and let others take care of you (for a change).
	9. Pick your surgeon carefully (a well experienced board-certified plastic surgeon) and trust in his/her advice. Keep in close communication with your surgeon and do not hesitate to communicate questions/concerns and the&nbsp;&nbsp; emotional swings that you may experience.
	10. Resume all medications that you were using preoperatively when cleared by your plastic surgeon and stop the use of narcotics and sedatives as soon as feasible after surgery.
	11. Keep in mind the end results as you go through the tougher emotional times after your surgery.

	Best wishes.

	The problem with noninvasive skin tightening is that everyone wants it and everyone wants to believe it works.&nbsp; The result is practitioners of all sorts capitalizing on this demand.&nbsp; The truth about skin tightening interventions is that almost all of them work AND NONE OF THEM WORK.&nbsp; What I mean by this is that there are many ways to convert energy into heat inside or below the skin causing contraction.&nbsp; The problem is that to deliver clinically effective results the tissue needs to reach at a minimum 43 C which is uncomfortable and can be scary for the patient and the practitioner.&nbsp; This often results in ineffective treatment and wasted time and money.&nbsp; I have developed extensive experience with noninvasive technologies mot because I'm a fan but because my patients demand it.&nbsp; After using several best in class technologies to deliver definitive results, my patients were relatively pleased but I was underwhelmed.&nbsp; THis is why I started using&nbsp; a treatment that we call Maerckks Multimodal Therapy(MMT) in my practice.&nbsp; All this is is an intelligently designed multitechnology treatment customized for the individual patient.&nbsp; I use multiple diffferent frequencies and administration systems for radiofrequency delivery, three different ultrasound frequencies, infrared pulsed light, two different laser systems in concert to deliver immediate significant results that are hard to argue with and continue improving for weeks.&nbsp; I think the only way to get real results is to combine technologies under the direction of a plastic surgeon that understands the capabilities and limitations of noninvasive skin tightening.&nbsp; No one technology really delivers anything significant.&nbsp; Also realiize that even my MMT results that I am very proud of do not remotely compare to what I can achieve with surgery and the cost can approach or exceed that of surgery depending on location and individual patient findings

13024099,question,,"Hi tinylefty,Thank you for your question regarding considering a mommy makeover after three previous C-sections, and which procedures are right for you being 51 and 115 pounds. Thank you for your history and your pictures.Lets analyze your stomach first. Upon examining your stomach, you have excess skin, excess fat, and muscle weakness. The excess skin can be seen by the wrinkles of your abdomen around the belly button. The wrinkles and the stretch marks also tell us about the quality of your skin and its ability to bounce back, especially after liposuction or a tummy tuck. In examining your abdomen, you also have a moderate amount of fat, which is evident in the profile pictures. Also, in the profile pictures, it appears that your muscle has been stretched. The muscle in question is the rectus abdominis muscle, probably stretched due to your small frame and having three large babies. Therefore, the best surgery for your abdomen is a tummy tuck, not just liposuction. A tummy tuck will address the excess skin and fat of your abdomen and correct the muscle weakness of your entire abdominal wall. During a tummy tuck, the excess skin in front of the abdomen will be removed, the pubic region or mons will be lifted, and the rectus muscle will be repaired.Lets now examine your breasts. If you are content with your breast size, you may consider a breast lift or a mastopexy. Your breast lift would include an incision around the areola and down the front of the breast, resembling a lollipop. If a more comprehensive lift is needed, this incision can be extended underneath the breast, resulting in whats called an anchor mastopexy. If you desire more fullness and a larger breast with enhanced cleavage, you might contemplate a breast implant. However, you mentioned youre not sure about having an implant in your body. In my opinion, combining a breast implant with a lift would offer optimal results. But, if you're against implants, that's perfectly understandable.In conclusion, I would recommend a tummy tuck, breast lift, and potentially a breast augmentation, depending on your personal preferences.

1174728,question,,"I understand how frustrating it is for fit, physically active people to take the required time off of their workout routine to heal completely.It really is a challenge for many of my patients to slow down their fitness routine following any kind of plastic surgery. Taking that down time will mean a faster and better recovery and it is a way to avoid complications. Please listen to the advice of your doctor and take it easy. Regular visits with your doctors office are the best way to ensure you know when you can resume certain activities.During surgery, most plastic surgeons will use pain pumps for pain control. This will help you feel better faster and allow you to start your routine sooner. Anesthesia, administered by an MD anesthesiologist who remains at the bedside of the patient during surgery means safety, more comfort and that too can mean a faster recovery.I urge athletic patients to find plastic surgeons with expertise performing breast augmnetation on athletes. Often female athletes have very minimal body fat and sometimes very limited breast tissue. Most women want a natural look from their brest augmnetation surgery, but professional athletes are often in attire that demands meticulous surgical technique and attention to every detail. My patients who are aerialists, fitness models or athletes in other sports want and need a feminine result from breast augmentation surgery.My patients who are career women and / or moms also want a natural result and often want to get back into their exerciseroutine as quickly as possible.The following are a few things that can distinguish some surgeons from others1) Graduating from a top tier medical school at the top of their class. 2) Membership in Alpha Omega Alpha. This is the medical honors society. Alpha Omega Alpha is to medicine what Phi Beta Kappa is to undergraduate universities3) Formal surgical training from prestigious medical universities. The minimum number of years of surgical training for plastic surgeons to be board certified is five years. Some physicians have as many as ten years of formal surgical training. There simply is no substitute for stelar academic and practical surgical training. 4) Very experienced surgeons with meticulous surgical technique and natural looking outcomes will have photgraphic evidence of their work. Patients should be able to view many photos of the surgery of interest, photgraphed from three different perspectives all with similar lighting, distance from the camera and croppingThe elite experience extends beyond the surgeon to the facility, and the surgical team. You should be able to see the surgical theater and know who else will be in the OR with you during surgery. The Joint Commission (JCAHO) is an organization that provides certification to hospital OR's. The Joint Commission and AAAASF are two of the organizations that can provide certification to surgical suites. Some plastic surgeons elect to have their surgery centers dually certified.The anesthesia experience is critical to a safe and comfortable surgical experience. A board certified anesthesiologist can administer general or MAC anesthesia. My preference is to have a board-certified anesthesiologist at the bedside of my patients for the duration of surgery.Plastic surgeons who cater to high profile individuals who place a high value on privacy will have a private first floor entrance and exit so patients never need to be in a public lobby or elevator for pre-operative or post operative visits.Michael Law MD  Member, Alpha Omega Alpha  Member, American Society Aesthetic Plastic Surgery  Certified, American Board of Plastic Surgery  Member, American Society Plastic Surgeons  Member, Royal Society of Medicine (England)  Member Phi Beta Kappa","Michael Law, MD answers: Advice for Exercise After Breast Augmentation?",/question/breast-implants-exercise

	&nbsp;No, this is an old wives tale and a very common question for me during consultation. &nbsp;Just because you have a Face Lift in your 40&#39;s that is performed following the proper aesthetics of facial beauty for the creation of a naturally, more attractive face and you look say, 10-15 years younger. &nbsp;There&#39;s no requiremnent for you to ever have anything else done, Face Lift, Brow Lift, whatever...and moe importantly, there&#39;s no penalty in 10 years for having done the initial Face Lift.

	&nbsp;Think of your face and your hypothetical exact twin before the surgery. &nbsp;Both show the same signs of aging. &nbsp;Now, you have an aesthetically inspired Face Lift making you look say, 12 years younger. &nbsp;The moment the Face Lift is finished, both you and your twins faces begin to age and will continue to do so for a decade and beyond. &nbsp;Ten years later, your face will still be at a better aesthetic point than your twin that has never had any improvements through surgery. &nbsp;If you choose to do something els, the aesthetic gap between you and your twin will widen further as long as the proper aesthetic principles are followed.

	&nbsp;Now, a similar question is the one that aks &quot;when&quot;....that&#39;s more an indivuidual decision on when you want to push back the clock. &nbsp;In the past 15 years, people are more inclined to have less invasive Face Lift procedures earlier and more often. &nbsp;This does two things. &nbsp;One, you look better, beginning at a younger age and stay that way longer and two, the amount of downtime is less than doing 1 six hour procedure in your 50&#39;s. &nbsp;But at the end of the day...it&#39;s what&#39;s best for you that rewally matters most. &nbsp;Hope this clears this up.

154684,question,,"I p[onder the same question myself. Drs. Prendiville and Aldea bring up great points to which I would like to add. As stated, you probably don't notice the good ones and that is part of the problem because the few bad ones you see can be terrifying. In an industry that is based predominantly on appearance, it is no doubt that plastic surgery is prevalent in Hollywood. The pressure is on to look good forever and surgery begins early. Clearly, actresses are having surgery at younger and younger ages and so it is not unusual that by the time a facelift becomes obvious, the actor/actress had had 2 or 3 or even more surgeries compared to the average person that may have one or at most 2 in their lifetime.Furthermore, celebrity often seek celebrity plastic surgeons without necessarily looking into their backgrouds or credentials. Despite all of Priscilla Presley's wealth she relied on a recommendation from Diane Richie (Lionel's wife at the time) and trusted her face to a Plastic surgery scam artist (not even a US licensed physician) Daniel Serrano who injected industrial grade silicone into her face with disastrous results. The fact that he was referred by a friend and charged reasonable rates ($300-500) per injection according to TMZ was appealing to these celebrities.More importantly, the desire to achieve better and better results in an attempt to look younger, thinner, or more beautiful often dirves these celebities to seek more and more surgery. Rather than accepting a good and natural result they request increasingly more aggressive and better results. There is an expression that the enemy of good is better. Think Michael Jackson. He had good results after the first or second nasal surgeries, but his drive to achieve a thinner and more refined tip produced a disaster. Some pursue plastic surgery repeatedly to achieve a better than normal result. Think Tara Reid. She had increasingly agressive liposuction to the point it caused irregularities. I have a saying that parallels the frequently quoted line: &quot;you're never thin enough&quot;; when it comes to Tara Reid for &quot;liposuction, you've never had enough until you've had too much.&quot;  Although plastic surgeons freqeuntly say no, some succumb to the requests of these influential celebrities. Think Kanye West's Mom. She was told no by other plastic surgeons but eventually pushed until she found one that would say yes.","Otto Joseph Placik, MD answers: Why do celebrity facelifts look so bad?",/question/celebrity-facelifts
12778202,question,,"You ask a number of questions and it makes this post fairly complex. The mons pubis often is a combination of skin laxity that causes excess fullness and subcutaneous fat. Try pulling up on the skin to see how much it changes the contour. The months pubis is easily fixed in conjunction with a tummy tuck. if youre planning a tummy tuck, you shouldnt need a second procedure to improve that part of your body. If skin laxity is a significant component, the liposuction alone may give limited results. Plastic surgeons have different opinions about doing a tummy tuck after having liposuction. I personally believe it has the negative variable, which is a diffuse layer of scar tissue that decreases the pliability or stretchiness of the skin and fat layer, which inhibits the potential aesthetic outcome from the tummy tuck.For that reason, I generally steer people towards having a tummy tuck first followed by Liposuction and fat transfer procedures at the second stage. Because the tummy tuck also generally gives the greatest impact. It makes sense to do the procedure if that has the greatest impact first. Theres no right or wrong approach to this and many surgeons differ in their approach, based on their understanding, experience and learning.Individuals who may not have enough fat for a proper BBL and want that procedure should probably have the BBL done first before removing viable fat unless the procedures are done as a combination with the tummy tuck.In the end, the two most important variables in quality cosmetic surgery outcomes are the patients candidacy for the procedure and choosing the right provider. Provider selection is by far the greatest and most important decision variable. I recommend patients have multiple in person consultations before choosing permanent irreversible body contouring procedure options.During each consultation, ask each provider to open up their portfolio and show you their entire collection of before, and after pictures of previous patients who had similar body characteristics to your own. An accomplished provider should have no difficulty showing you the before and after pictures of at least 50 previous patients.Theres no correct number of consultations needed to find the right provider the more consultations you have the more likely you are to find the best provider in your community.Best,Mats Hagstrom, MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Age 30, BMI 25%, should I liposuction my mons pubis & hips before tummy tuck?

1386870,question,,"Hi and thank you for your question. The answer is yes. With the use of selective liposculpture I feel that you could obtain the elusive hour glass figure that so many women are looking for. &nbsp;I don't particularly like using the term Brazilian butt lift to signify a &nbsp;shapelier buttock. Instead I prefer the term buttock enhancement. This simply means that the buttock area is enhanced whether with fat transfer (BBL) , buttock implants or selective liposuction. I feel you could benefit from lipo of the hips, flanks, possibly the abdomen and more important the sacral area of your back. This will create a sacral hollow to accentuate the scooped out look that really enhances the profile of your buttocks. I encourage you to be very diligent about your research.

4526217,question,,"How to choose the best Hair transplant surgeon?This is one of the most difficult things to do especially when many surgeons write the same things on their websites. However, still you got to choose one. So, I think asking the following questions can help you to make up your mind in a better way.1. Education &training: Is the doctor Board Certified?This is the first parameter which should be taken into account at the time of choosing the doctor. The American Board Certified or the Fellows of the ISHRS who have proven their hard work, dedication and commitment to the cause of hair transplantation in the professional examination format as well as amongst the peer group always hold an edge over the rest of the doctors.2. Experience: For how long has the doctor been practicing Hair transplant?The longer the period, the more is the chance of his delivering the better results. But make sure that you ask about his experience of doing hair transplants and not just practicing medicine.3. Is the doctor exclusively practicing hair transplant or doing it along with other procedures?A doctor who is exclusively practicing hair transplant is always better than the one who is doing it as just one of the procedures4. Are you happy with the results put up on their website or brochures?Results are one of the most important criteria to select your doctor. But make sure that the pics are not photoshopped. Rather, it is difficult to morph the videos, so it is always better to judge the results from the result videos or the video testimonials. Then you should be able to appreciate the naturalness of the hairline, the softness, and coverage of the recipient area. Not only this, you should also see the donor area as most of the patients undergoing huge FUE sessions often land with moth eaten appearance of the scalp after surgery.5. Does your doctor regularly attends the conferences and present his work in the conferences?A doctor who keeps on attending the conferences is more updated about the new advances in his field as compared to the other one. If he also presents his work regularly, then there is a fair chance that he is respected in his peer group and his opinion will carry more weightage6. Does your doctor do the surgery himself?Nowadays, the number of hair transplant surgeries have increased but so has the number of shadow surgeries i.e. the surgery which is to be done by the doctors is being performed by the technicians. The surgeon just consults and doesnt do the extraction or the slit making process as is recommended by the bigger associations of hair transplant like the ISHRS or the AHRS India. Just make it clear from your surgeon that who is going to do these two steps7. Has your doctor clearly understood your concerns?According to me, if you have got a favorable answer to all the above questions, then it is most important to find out if your surgeon has clearly understood your concerns. You will not be satisfied if after transplant, you get a good crop of hair but this was not what you wanted.In the end, I would like to say that you should take proper time and do adequate research to make your choice because the Hair once lost from the donor area will be lost forever.","Kapil Dua, MBBS, MS answers: Hair Transplant Surgeons: The best of the best, the ones that don't advertise?",/question/new-orleans-la-hair-transplant-surgeons-advertise
8273446,question,,"Like all surgery, it has to be done right.When it is, it provides all the advantages of a rapid, more comfortable recovery with none of the disadvantages of drains.Drains do not prevent seromas in a significant percentage of cases, and seromas require aspiration, often 2-3 times, and further measures including surgery if they do not resolve.Although a small seroma may occur with the use of the drainless progressive-tension suture technique, it islikely to be small and easily resolved with aspiration or a seroma catheter.All the risks associate with fluid collections shift in the downward direction of frequency and/or severity.Thesutures should be placed nicely so they do not tether or dimple the skin, and they should be sufficient to do the job of closing the open space created when the flap is elevated.Drainlesstummy tucks are an integral part of my procedure. Even with drainsor tissue glue there is a a 5-45 % incidence of seroma per the literature. Ameta-analysis in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal,AesthetSurg J.2017 Mar 1;37(3):316-323. doi: 10.1093/asj/sjw192.SeretisK, Goulis, D, Demiri EC, Lykoudis, EGPreventionof Seroma Formation Following Abdominoplasty: A Systematic Review andMeta-Analysisreviewedall the literature on this topic, and found that preventivemeasures decreased the incidence of seroma four-fold. One of the studiesincludedin the preventive groupthatusedonlyprogressive tension sutures, from 2006, showed fluidaccumulation between the sutures, detected only on ultrasound. This fluid wasnot clinically detectable by palpation or inspection and resulted in no needfor seroma aspiration or any complication. The total amount of fluid associatedwith clinical complications including drainage in the other groupswasgreater than 80 cc, and the total amount of non-clinicallydetectablefluid in the progressive-tension group was always 80 cc orless. The use of drains plus progressive tension sutures did not change theamount of fluid, so there is really no benefit to using drains plus progressivetensionsutures.Thestudy was discussed by Pollock and Pollock, who noted that in their series of565 patients using progressive tension sutures they never had a clinicallysignificant seroma. When a seroma occurs, it may require multiple visits andaspirations, and if persistent, introduction of antibiotic sclerosingsolutions, or reoperation to remove a fluid filled fibrous cavity.Thedrain opening may leave a scar in the incision or pubic mons which may becomepigmented or depressed. Not having to use drains spares the patient and plasticsurgeon from the chance of these undesirable events and/or outcomes.Myexperience mirrors that of Drs. Pollack. I have had no clinicallysignificant seromaswhile using progressive tension sutures in the pastfive years or so.Ratherthan use the 15-20 individually-placed sutures described by Drs.Pollock,I completely close the dead space with continuous PDO and monoderm Quillsutures. These sutures effectively reduce the dead space to almost nothing, soeven the small amount of fluid that might collect between the sutures, cannotcreate any significant seroma. Using running Quill sutures allows relativelyrapid dead space closure as no knot-tying is needed. The umbilical location isconfirmed with a Lockwood flap marker before the lower abdominal closure iscompleted.","Robert M.

8046159,question,,"Hello and thank you for your question and your pictures.First of all, congratulations on maintaining your weight loss. It is a great step in getting you ready for a tummy tuck.Although you would be best served with an exam in person, from your photographs alone it appears that you are a good&nbsp;candidate for a tummy tuck with some body contouring using liposuction.&nbsp; Liposuction can help give you a much curvier silhouette especially by removing the excess tissues at the flanks.&nbsp;Pregnancy oftentimes will leave a woman with stretched out abdominal muscles that do not recover their pre-pregnancy state. Any resulting bulging appearance of the belly will not be fixed with exercise only but can only be adequately addressed with plication (tightening) of the muscles, which is performed during a tummy tuck.There are several ways to do a tummy tuck and every plastic surgeon likely does it slightly differently.&nbsp;When I&nbsp;perform a tummy tuck&nbsp;I&nbsp;do not&nbsp;use drains&nbsp;and I have been extremely happy with the results. I use a technique called progressive tension sutures in which the sutures hold the abdominal skin in place and help&nbsp;minimize the space for any fluid to collect.The no drain tummy tuck makes recovery much easier for my patients. Without the drains, patients are able to walk after surgery without the worry of the drains being pulled on and it avoids any pain or discomfort associated with the drains at&nbsp;the skin where they exit. Another technique I use during my tummy tuck&nbsp;is injection of Exparel,&nbsp;which is a long lasting local anesthetic that I&nbsp;place along the muscles that are tightened to help with pain relief during the recovery process.Sometimes a tummy tuck can be combined with liposuction and also surgery on the&nbsp;breasts such as an augmentation, a reduction, a lift, or a combination.&nbsp;You can expect most of the recovery process and activity restrictions to be directed by the tummy tuck especially with the muscle separation repair. You should plan for light duty with lifting no more than 5-10 lbs for 4-6 weeks to allow your body to adequately heal.Be sure to seek a consultation with a board-eligible or board-certified plastic surgeon who specializes in aesthetic plastic surgery and be sure they address all your concerns about liposuction and tummy tuck including the risks and benefits of the procedures, recovery time and postoperative course.&nbsp;I believe a key component of the consultation is to establish a good connection with your plastic surgeon. If you dont feel you have a good connection after your consultation then they may not be the best surgeon for you.&nbsp;Good luck!Olivier A.

	If you are a mother who has completed her childbearing, congratutions both on your wonderful family you have created and to entering the next stage of motherhood!

	Many women find their abdomens have permanent changes following pregnancy, including stretch marks, loss of abdominal tone, excess skin and extra fat deposits that have accumulated since having babies.

	Most mothers do not have complete recovery of their bodies after children.

	Moms often seek rejuvenation of their tummy areas once they have finished having kids.

	A &quot;mommy makeover&quot; surgical procedure should only be considered at least 6 months after the birth of your last child so that your body has the chance to recover as much as possible and to enable you to achieve as much as you can on your own, with a healthy diet and regular exercise.

	Two main Plastic Surgery procedures apply to the post-pregnancy tummy:

	Liposuction will remove excess fat in areas that are stubborn to weight loss, such as the abdomen, flanks, pubic area, and thighs. Liposuction will not address excess skin or stretch marks, and will not help to tighten abdominal tone.

	An abdominoplasty or &quot;tummy tuck&quot; addresses both the inside and the outside of the abdominal wall, in a three-dimensional manner:

	Tummy tuck surgery not only removes excess skin and fat from the lower abdomen (including some stretch marks), it tightens the muscles of the abdominal wall through &quot;rectus plication&quot; which &quot;corsets&quot; the fascia overlying your abdominal muscles together in the midline and truly decreases the diameter of your waist from the inside!

	Depending on your particular situation, either liposuction or a tummy tuck, or both, may be recommended to achieve your specific goals.

	Be sure to consult with a Board-Certified Plastic Surgeon with specific experience in these types of surgeries to learn more and to evaluate all of your options.

7674354,question,,"FIRST 3-4 DAYS POSTOPAfter a rhinoplasty procedure packings are placed in the nose and a split or cast is put on the nose to protect it during the healing period and assure the best possible results.&nbsp;The nasal packings are removed 3 to 4 days after the surgery, depending if it was only an aesthetic procedure or a functional one as well.During these first 3 days, it is recommended to ice the back of your neck and occasionally the eyes, to minimize the bleeding, bruising and swelling. It's best to use ice packs/ ice gel because they are easy to mold to your face and neck. You should ice the areas periodically during the day, but don't have to do it during the night.&nbsp;Although complete bed rest is not necessary in this period, you need to take it easy and will probably not have the desire to go out in the first 3 days.3-7 DAYS POSTOPAfter the packings are out, the rest of the&nbsp;recovery will be a lot easier, since they do bring a certain amount of discomfort (unable to breathe through the nose, feeling of stuffiness and pressure, you won't be able to taste food, etc.). You can also start going on walks, eating more solid food and even grab a coffee with a friend, if you feel like it. Keep in mind, you will still be wearing a cast over your nose and have some bandages on your face.7  14 DAYS POSTOPOn the 7th postoperative day, the splint comes off the nose and you will be able to see the results of your surgery for the first time. At this point I usually do a full check up of the nose (outside and inside), clean up the inside of the nose from residial dried blood and make sure everything is OK. The nose will be swollen at this point, especially if the tip was operated on as well, because the nasal tip is the most sensitive part, swells up the most and takes the longest to get back to normal. There might also be some bruising left, usually around the eyes, which you can cover up with make up. In this period you can get back to most of your personal and professional activities (back to work).2 WEEKS  2 MONTHS POSTOPMost of the swelling goes down in the first 2 months after the surgery. Usually, this is on average 10-20% from the moment the cast is removed from the nose.In this period (4 to 8 weeks) you can slowly get back to your sports activities, but be sure to check with your doctor first, because it does depend on the activity/sport. For instance, after 4 weeks you can slowly start doing cardio exercise (i.e. jogging), but for high-intensity exercise and contact sports wait until the full 8 weeks are through, because this is how long it takes for all the bones to fully heal.2 MOTHS  1 YEAR POSTOPIn certain cases, depending on the individual and the type of surgery, some swelling can be present up to a year and the nose can still change slightly in this period. This is why most surgeons won't recommend doing any type of revision procedures within the first year.&nbsp;","Dinko Toncic, MD answers: Rhinoplasty Recovery Time and Downtime?",/question/how-long-will-it-take-heal-after-nose-job

12320361,question,,"Liposuction is probably sufficient for it they are yes you describe it. Your middle abdomen is bulging because of excess of visceral fat which is most likely related to weight gain or simply obesity. you can most likely flatten your abdomen substantially by dropping five or 10 pounds.Having had a tummy tuck your mons pubis is probably not related to skin laxity but its still possible. fullness in that area is often a combination of skin laxity and excess fat. Having had a previous tummy tuck its more likely to be all fat related.Delivering consistent quality liposuction results is more difficult than most people believe in. This includes plastic surgeons. most plastic surgeons are not as good at Liposuction as they think they are.Mastering this procedure which is often thought of it as being quite simplistic its in fact very difficult and takes a lifetime commitment.To find the best provider I suggest scheduling multiple in person consultations avoiding virtual consultations whenever possible.During each consultation ask each provider to show their entire collection of before and after pictures for the areas interested in being treated. look especially for patients with similar body characteristics to your own.An experienced provider should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of quality before and after pictures of commonly performed procedures.I dont like using the term flanks because people have a different understandings of what the flanks area actually represents.I generally view the torso as a single anatomic unit and when it comes to Liposuction and generally try to treat the entire torso to leave people with an even natural thin fat distribution.This is sometimes adjusted in some circumstances especially if people of had a previous cosmetic surgery like yourself.Personally I do all liposuction work with patients awake using local anesthesia with mild sedation. I find this to be far better than using general anesthesia for multiple reasons. first and foremost is the ability for patients to move on their own and whole different anatomic positions while Im contouring their body.There are multiple other advantages. In the end the form of anesthesia is not nearly as important as choosing the right provider who has the skills with a proven background of having mastered this procedure.Continue having consultation until you found the right provider.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Fat above my vigina, side flanks, inter thighs - what do you recommend?

	I love this question because it tells me that you have already made up your mind to fix the things that bother you after pregnancy. &nbsp;That means you have made the first step. &nbsp;That one is the easiest. &nbsp;The second is finding the right surgeon. &nbsp;Lastly then it comes to paying for it. &nbsp;Here are some guidelines for you:

	Research by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons has shown that on average women spend about&nbsp;five years&nbsp;thinking about getting a cosmetic procedure before they take the next step. &nbsp;That is followed by about ten to fifteen months of asking around about surgeons and researching them before calling for that first appointment. &nbsp;After those first consultations these patients moved quickly, in general getting the surgery scheduled about six to twelve weeks later. &nbsp;Are there reasons to wait? &nbsp;iI depends on what stage you are in based on this research. &nbsp;I tell my patients the following items:

	1 You should not get breast surgery until at least three to four months after you are done breast feeding.

	2 If you have toddlers at home you will not feel much like picking them up or putting them in a car seat for at least a week. &nbsp;Gauge your support network for that first week. &nbsp;If you only have your husband to help you for one day after surgery should you wait until the toddlers are older? &nbsp;Or get more help from your mom or your best friend?

	3 Recovery is not that painful after the first few days for most women but some women are not off of narcotics for two weeks or more. &nbsp;Be prepared if that is you. &nbsp;Again judge your own pain threshold and act accordingly. &nbsp;Did it take weeks for you to get over your wisdom teeth extraction or just hours?

7570437,question,,"Dear Mom of Boys 0917,Hello and thank you for your excellent question. We frequently perform extensive liposuction and skin excision (what we call a Mini Tummy Tuck) under local anesthesia only. However, we do not perform any muscle repair under these conditions, as you need to be completely asleep for this.I have found that many patients can get GOOD results with liposuction alone, and EXCELLENT results with IDEAL Liposuction! IDEAL Lipo is a proprietary technique that we have been developing for the past 12 years. First off, these procedures are typically performed in the office, with only local anesthesia (although patients can request deeper sedation, if they so desire). We typically use Smart / Laser Liposuction or VASER (ultrasound) to reduce dense, fibrous fat, and stimulate collagen formation; Radiofrequency-based skin tightening (like Body Tite, or Thermi) to maximize skin contraction; and Ultrasound, RF, or subcision (Z Wave, Venus, Cellfina) to treat cellulite. Patients go home the day of surgery; typically do not use any narcotics postop for pain control, and are back to light exercise and work 48 hours after their procedures. In my practice, we specifically evaluate patients for these additional treatments, and select the appropriate treatment based on their skin quality, amount of fat, previous treatment(s), and surgical goals. It is best to answer your question during a face-to-face evaluation, when you can discuss your goals and expectations for the procedure, and you can have a physical examination to evaluate for that procedure.I recommend that you find a board-certified, or board-eligible plastic surgeon with whom you are comfortable. Be sure to have all of your questions answered during a face-to-face meeting with your surgeon, and review before and after pictures of similar patients whom have had this procedure. If you have any questions, call our office for assistance. Good luck!

63746,question,,"There are many reasons to wait six months before having a tummy tuck.The deep layer, or fascia is both ripped and stretched.  The stretching is largely recovered by 6 months; the ripping of course is not.  That is what the deep layer of the tummy tuck improves.  The hormones that cause the deep fascial layer to soften to accommodate the baby are no longer active  by six months.  The tissues literally hold stitches better.  This is one of the many reasons most plastic surgeons won't perform a tummy tuck at the same time as a C-section.Women who are breast feeding give whatever is in their bloodstream to the nursing child.  There are also risks to the baby to giving an anesthetic to a woman who is actively breast feeding.  This can be overcome by pumping and discarding the milk during the period the woman has anesthetic or pain medication in her bloodstream, but it is a disruption.Many women are still struggling with their baby weight after the birth of their child.  It is hard work, but well worth it to become as active as possible after childbirth to lose that baby weight.Women who are shortly postpartum have to lift their babies frequently. Frequent heavy lifting can damage the results of a tummy tuck, especially if a hernia repair is performed at the same time.  By six months, most moms have their routines down and are more efficient with lifting their babies.The goal is of course to return to a pre-pregnancy weight.  While this is often possible with a great diet and lifestyle, occasionally it is not.  Women are often demoralized by their post-baby appearance and, despite very hard work, reach a stubborn plateau.  If this is the case, it is generally acceptable to have tummy tuck surgery.  Many women find that after their tummy tuck surgeries they now are able to see the results of their efforts better, and are structurally better able to work out without having the loose skin and loose fascia hampering them.","Brent Moelleken, MD answers: How long should I wait to get a tummy tuck after pregnancy?",/question/how-long-should-wait-get-tummy-tuck-after-pregnancy
10979538,question,,"Of the treatment options they are full tummy tuck vs liposuction.  Emsculpt is not on the list.  Its a temporary treatment that in reality only gives muscle strengthening.  I dont think having stronger abdominal muscles will be visible through your fat layer and mod skin laxity. You could consider just liposuction if you just want contour improvements.  It will not give you tight skin so if you want that you should consider the full tummy tuck.I recommend patients avoid traveling long distances for elective surgical procedures. There are of course instances where there is a lack of local talent and traveling to some degree is inevitable. If traveling for the procedure patients should be ready to travel to have the consultation, post operative appointments and follow up should there be issues or complications.Patients sometimes do not appreciate the importance of in person consultations, that complications do happen or the number of people who have issues with their results or need revisions.Schedule multiple consultations with different providers in your area who seem to have a good reputation for the procedure youre interested in. Starting with at least five consultations seems like a reasonable number to me.Whenever possible schedule in person consultations.  During in person consultations ask each plastic surgeon to show all of their before and after pictures for the procedure youre interested in. The goal is not to see the best results of their career but to get an idea of what average results look like and get some type of confirmation of how many of these procedures that provider has performed. Ask to see results that were not as good as the doctor wouldve hoped for and talk about the differences in outcomes. Honest and experienced providers should have no problems presenting this type of information.A highly experienced plastic surgeon should have hundreds of before and after pictures for the procedure youre interested in. At a minimum at least 20+.Read all the reviews on various physician review websites paying close attention and avoiding providers with any significant number of justified negative reviews.  Providers with an abundance of reviews often have aggressive marketing campaigns.The plastic surgeons I respect most all have the single variable of not having justified negative reviews on their online profiles. In my opinion justified negative reviews are far more telling than an abundance of positive reviews.Avoid scheduling for surgery or making a deposit on the day of the consultation.  Give yourself some time to think about the decision and make sure you finished all scheduled consultations before committing to having surgery that will permanently and irreversibly change your body.When in doubt slow down and schedule more consultations.Choosing the right plastic surgeon is the single most important variable to having a positive experience. Dont go chasing after technology or names of certain equipment. Instead focus all your efforts on finding the most experienced and talented board-certified plastic surgeon.Best, Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Am I a better candidate for Emsculpt or a tummy tuck?

210666,question,,"A Mommy Makeover, like all other surgies will have a wide range of prices depending on your doctors level of expertise, training, surgical facilities, and the results they provide.&nbsp;The cost of a Mommy Makeover depends on what the mommy makeover will consist of. &nbsp;No two women are exactly alike, therefore, the procedures administered and the cost will be different depending on the woman.&nbsp; Some plastic surgeons define a breast augmentation and lift (augmentation mastopexy) plus a tummy tuck (abdominoplasty) as a mommy makeover. But, in my practice, each woman has a different idea of what it means to get her pre-baby body back and that is very individualized. Therefore, the price has a significant range.&nbsp;A Mommy Makeover surgery is a very significant surgery. In my practice, I have my mommy makeover patients stay in our facility overnight with two RN's providing overnight care to be sure my patients feel as comfortable as possible and to provide peace of mind for patients and their families. &nbsp;It is essential to feel safe and comfortable with your choice of surgeon, surgical team and surgicla facility prior to scheduling a mommy makeover.&nbsp;The following are a few things that can distinguish some surgeons from others1) Graduating from a top tier medical school at the top of their class. 2) Membership in Alpha Omega Alpha. This is the medical honors society. Alpha Omega Alpha is to medicine what Phi Beta Kappa is to letters 3) Formal surgical training from prestigious medical universities. The minimum number of years of surgical training for plastic surgeons to be board certified in five years. Some physicians have as many as ten years of formal surgical training. There simply is no substitute for stelar academic and practical surgical training. 4) Very experienced surgeons with meticulous surgical technique and natural looking outcomes will have photographic evidence of their work. Patients should be able to view many photos of the surgery of interest, photographed from three different perspectives all with similar lighting, distance from the camera and croppingThe elite experience extends beyond the surgeon to the facility, and the surgical team. You should be able to see the surgical theater and know who else will be in the OR with you during surgery. The Joint Commission (JCAHO) is an organization that provides certification to hospital OR's. The Joint Commission and AAAASF are two of the organizations that can provide certification to surgical suites. Some plastic surgeons elect to have their surgery centers dually certified.The anesthesia experience is critical to a safe and comfortable surgical experience. A board certified anesthesiologist can administer general or MAC anesthesia. My preference is to have a board-certified anesthesiologist at the bedside of my patients for the duration of surgery.Plastic surgeons who cater to high profile individuals who place a high value on privacy will have a private first floor entrance and exit so patients never need to be in a public lobby or elevator for pre-operative or post operative visits. Breast Lift and Augmentation (Augmentation Mastopexy) may be an ideal option for many moms An increasingly attractive and popular option for breast enhancement, particularly in women who have been through pregnancy and lactation, is the combination of a vertical mastopexy (breast lift) with breast augmentation. This is the ideal breast surgery procedure for women seeking breast enhancement who have experienced breast volume 'deflation' following pregnancy and lactation (and for those with 'deflated' appearing breasts who have never been pregnant), and who have the desire for a fuller breast profile. &nbsp;For many women, a tummy tuck alone can be defined as a mommy makeover. Many moms that I see for tummy tucks are very fit and in good physical condition, but despite efforts to 'slim down' through diet and exercise, the middle third of their body just doesn't match their more slender upper and lower thirds. As with all aesthetic surgeries, I attempt to restore a sense of harmony and balance to a patients figure when I perform an abdominoplasty. A tummy tuck is designed to accomplish two things: Remove excess abdominal skin and fat Tighten and flatten the abdominal wall muscles The surgery is performed through a 'bikini-line incision' which, for a full tummy tuck, may extend from hipbone to hipbone. For patients that need only a 'mini-tummy tuck', the incision is usually somewhat smaller, extending just beyond the limits of the average C-section scar. The suprapubic incisions used for this operation are designed so that the resulting surgical scar is hidden by underwear or a bathing suit. A full abdominoplasty requires the surgical creation of a new belly button. Creating the new belly button, which is called an umbilicoplasty, is a part of tummy tuck surgery that requires a great deal of attention and finesse on the part of the surgeon. My goal is to create a new belly button that, as much as possible, resembles a 'natural' belly button. Natural belly buttons do NOT look like a perfect circle, and circular umbilicoplasty scars are a tummy tuck dead giveaway. My suggestion is&nbsp;to seek out plastic surgeons&nbsp;referred by friends, family or medical professionals, do research online and then have a consultation with a few to determine who has an understanding of what you are hoping to achieve with experience doing just that.&nbsp;Most practices will be able to provide many before and after photographs and patients you can speak to about&nbsp;their surgical experience.&nbsp; Never jump into surgery with haste. Take your time and think about what is really important to you and NEVER be pressured by practices encouraging you to schedule surgery quickly, especially if there are specials or perks for scheduling sooner than later. Most plastic surgeons with satisfied patients and busy practices keep busy with referrals and do not need to offer specials or financing.&nbsp; Take your time selecting your doctor and don't select a plastic surgeon based exclusively on price.","Michael Law, MD answers: How much does a Mommy makeover cost?",/question/mommy-makeover-cost
12568135,question,,"There are multiple explanations why you could have fullness in this area.Does seven continues fat layer naturally becomes thin at the lower abdomen transitions to the mons pubis. This varies somewhat between individuals but most people have a subcutaneous fat layer that becomes thin right between the lower abdomen and the pubic area. The subcutaneous fat is usually thickest around the belly button.When that stripper skin is removed during a mini tummy tuck the two skin edges better approximated with stitches often have a mismatch with a fat from the mid abdomen Bing thicker than it is just above the pubic area. When that stripper skin is removed during a mini tummy tuck the two skin edges better approximated with stitches often have a mismatch with a fat from the mid abdomen being thicker than it is just above the pubic area. Well this is the case and plastic surgeons should remove fat from the upper skin edge so there isnt a step off at the incision(scar).If you have previous pregnancies then you most likely having muscle separation and abdominal bulging causes the same appearance as well.There are generally four variables that determine what someones abdomen looks like.If someone doesnt like the way they rub them and looks it is almost always because of one or more of those four variables. This is generally true whether someone has had cosmetic surgery or not.Before variables are abdominal skin laxity, excess subcutaneous fat, muscle separation from previous pregnancies or excess visceral or intra-abdominal fat, The contour irregularity is related to one of those four. It shouldnt be rocket science to figure out if the subcutaneous fat layer its thicker just above your scar than below the scar. it also shouldnt be that difficult to determine if your muscle wall bulges.If its a mismatch with thicker subcutaneous fat above the scar because of failure to defend the upper skin edge appropriately then this could be easily improved with a small amount of liposuction.To make a quality assessment on the outcome of the surgical procedure we generally always want to see proper before and after pictures. If you dont have before and after pictures and ask your surgeon to forward the ones they took and always show before and after pictures if you want input on the outcome of your procedure.My best guess is this represents a slight difference in subcutaneous fat thickness combined with mild muscle separation.I suggest having a few in person Second opinion consultations.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Firm bulge above incision 8 months after tummy tuck - what could this be?

446165,question,,"
	First an explanation of what happened to you and then we will go over your options.

	It appears you were quite sick when you presented to the hospital and your surgeons knew they had to operate on you but were not sure the process was a contained appendicitis. To leave all their options (and visibility) open they decided NOT to go through a classic right lower quadrant (McBurney) incision and opted for an infraumbilical midline incisions which allows access to the entire pelvis.&nbsp; They must have encountered a ruptured appendix and tried closing the skin surface anyway but a skin infection with anaerobic organisms (air intolerant germs as are found in the colon) took place. The solution - exactly what they did. Open the skin surface, let air in and clean the wound with daily dressing changesuntil the infection cleared AND the wound resurfaced (referred to in surgical speak as healing by secondary intention)

	Your options at this time are:
	- do nothing. Of course nothing will change for better or worse.
	- REVISE the scar. The scar CAN be significantly made better by using Plastic surgery principles and techniques
	- PUNT - You can delay the revision until AFTER you complete your family. Odds are that if you are like the vast majority of women, the baby(ies) would stretch the tummy wall and underlying muscles sufficiciently so at the time of a subsequent Tummy Tuck or Mommy MakeOver ALL the skin span from the belly button to your Mons pubia (including this ugly scar) can easily be removed. It will be exchanged for a much nicer and thinner transverse scar hidden in your panties&#39; confines.

	The choice is yours.

	Good Luck.

8821001,question,,"Patients often think in terms of cup size when considering augmentation. Unfortunately, devices are sized in terms of milliliters (cc) of volume. This can lead to some confusion when sizing. Additionally, it is important to remember that cup size itself is not standardized with variations from one manufacturer to another. Unfortunately, as many women can attest their cup size in an industry leader such as VS is not necessarily transferable to another brand.Another point which is often under appreciated is that of anatomy and starting point. Any implant will add volume to the volume which is already present. The implant is additive. A particular volume willnot necessarily confer the same cup size to different patients (often times it will not even confer the same cup size to different breasts in the same individual...remember they are sisters not twins).A general rule of thumb is that 125cc can represent somewhere between 1/2 to a full cup size increase. Smaller volume differentials (25-50cc) are typically less consequential representing a volumechange of less than a shot glass. However, I have found these numbers, at least anecdotally, to be of little help. Patients often present with notions/goals which do not correlate with these sorts of sterile volumetric assessments.When sizing patients, there are a number of useful tools including:-3D imaging (has the added benefit of offering a volumetric analysis of the pre-operative breast)-Breast sizers (rice bags)-Goal photosI also recommend that patients commit to a particular look rather than a cup size. Once a patient settles on a look that pleases them the overall cup size increase becomes less relevant.The key to obtaining a natural result is to stay within the parameters defined by your BWD.On a smaller frame such as yours, I would encourage conservative sizing. Consideration ofhigher profile device (greater volume for a given BWD) is more common in smaller frames. However, this becomes a question of whether the volume which can be delivered in a Mod (+) device is adequate.As always, discuss your concerns with a board certified plastic surgeon (ABPS).Donovan Rosas MDBoard Certified by theAmerican Board of Plastic SurgeryMember: American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery,American Society of Plastic SurgeonsRealSelf Top 100RealSelf Hall of Fame","Donovan Rosas, MD answers: I am petite, 51, 115 lbs, but have a wide ribcage/chest width, 12 cm.

8401836,question,,"Dear&nbsp;One happy Mom,determining whether you need simply a breast augmentation versus a breast lift can be somewhat complicated. It depends on a number of factors including skin laxity and current nipple position. Generally speaking, if the nipples are lower than the inframammary line the patient will most likely need a breast lift. If the nipples are at or above the inframammary line we can generally get by with just a breast augmentation depending on the size of the implant the patient wants. I often still using implant when I perform a breast lift because it provides more upper breast fullness after the lift. Breast implant type and sizing selection is a complicated process and requires a detailed consultation that includes a discussion of your goals, a detailed examination, and a lengthy discussion. But the decision will always start and end with the patient.&nbsp;When it comes to sizing, we have all of our patients find 3 photos of their desired breast size. We ask for naked breast photos because clothing can obscure the true size (push up bras). Next, we consult with patients and go over the photos and take detailed breast measurements during a physical exam. Next, we using a sizing algorithm to determine a range of implants that will work based on the exam and the measurements.Lastly, during the operation, we use silicone sizers in the operating room to see how the size actually looks in the breast. We sit the patient up in the operating room, while asleep of course, and compare the sizer result with their desired look photos. If it is too small, we start the process over with a slightly larger implant. We don't stop until we get the perfect match.Of all of my breast augmentation patients, every one of them has been happy with their size due to this detailed and meticulous process. You don't want to invest time and money into a result that is either too big or too small.You should discuss your concerns with a board-certified plastic surgeon and make sure that your surgeon understands your goals.Daniel Barrett, MDCertified, American Board of Plastic SurgeryMember, American Society of Plastic SurgeryMember, American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery","Daniel Barrett, MD answers: I have always had natural 32DDD, when pregnant went up to a G, post baby still a 32DDD what size imp",/question/natural-32ddd-pregnant-g-post-baby-32ddd-size-implant
7829544,question,,"The first thing I want to emphasize is that you posted your question and image after a procedure in 2010. As with all medical technologies, BodyTite has been upgraded and improved since that time, and the treatments done now are much different than what was done before.Software issues are solved over time, mechanical and physical parts are improved and redesigned, and procedures, settings, and treatmentprotocols are refined and perfected, so that the results we would expect now are much more reliable and better than back in 2010.That's not to say things were bad back then; it was the state of the art, and honestly we should expect that our art improves with time.As far as what can be done to correct your specific issues, you may have a number of options. Which of these is best will only be determined during a personal consultation however, as things like tone and pliability of tissues, perhaps certain measurements, and and overall assessment of your physique and tissue quality can only be obtained with a physical exam.While abdominoplasty, or tummy tuck, has been discussed as a possible option to redrape your skin and remove excess, this obviously has some drawbacks, and while if it is for sure the best option then we should do it, but if there are other less aggressive or invasive options that will provide a solution, then a procedure of that magnitude may be extreme. Things like lipo-equalization, which is essentially a procedure using power assisted liposuction equipment not necessarily to remove additional fat (although that can certainly be done where needed), but to break upand equalize the thickness of the fat layer to get rid of the contour irregularities that are present.This can also be combined with some fat grafting in areas where too much fat has been removed or damaged, even when there is fibrous scar, to also create more of an even contour.If there is so much laxity, or sagging of the skin, additional tightening beyond what can simply be obtained with liposuction or lipoequalization may be needed, and that's where an option like BodyTite (new version!) or Thermi may have some value, or in the most extreme case, we arrive back at tummy tuck as the best option to address really loose skin.So you can see that there are a number of ways that this problem can be approached, it's just that with the limited images and information that we have here, and no physical exam, it will be impossible to provide you with any more specific information than this. The best advice I can give is for you to make appointments with several board certified plastic surgeons who have experience not only with all of these options, but also with revisional, or corrective surgery, for this kind of thing, as they will be the only ones prepared to discuss the pros and cons of all of the available options and give you the best advice as to which one you should go with.  In addition to being certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, the only generally recognized organization which certifies true plastic surgeons and has the term Plastic Surgery in its title, your surgeon should also participate in the Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program administered by that board. This program requires that surgeons who participate continue to update their credentials and professional standing regularly, as opposed to practicing on a single lifetime certificate like those plastic surgeons who elect not to participate. To find further information about this program and any surgeons you might consider for your surgery, I suggest visiting these sites: abplsurg.org and abms.org. Good luck.","Joseph L.

12339075,question,,"The time to review before and after pictures or wish pictures is during the consultation. You can bring them in during the day of surgery but at that point its a little late for making any major changes. The most important variable when reviewing before and after pictures especially when reviewing wish pictures is making sure the patients in the before pictures have similar body characteristics to your own. If not then the wish pictures are pointless.I recommend you get pictures of your own body taken the same way plastic surgeons take before and after pictures and use those for comparison when reviewing before and after pictures.Be honest about using a wish pictures and make sure the patients had the same type of skin laxity, overall body shape, amount of body fat and overall contour as you to understand what results can or cannot look like.The variables that surgeons have control over include getting a natural looking belly button which is one of the hardest parts of the procedure. This in combination with a very low set scar that follows anatomic contours naturally and is even on both sides is the hallmark of quality work. The incision should be low enough to basically sit in the groin crease. personally I prefer to make the incision slightly convex over the mons pubis and after that point follow the groin crease. for individuals with extensive skin laxity the procedure should be extended accordingly.For individuals who have excess fat or skin laxity and their love handles liposuction should be incorporated with a procedure or an extended tummy tuck should be performed were both skin and fat can be surgically excised to create a good contour view from any angle including from behind.If you have questions or concerns about your upcoming procedure then I would encourage you to schedule a preop visit sooner rather than later so you can discuss your questions and concerns before the day of surgery.Theres nothing wrong with having a second consultation or schedule a preop visit before the procedure. I courage patients to do this when they have any questions and some surgeons have a specific preop visit to go over last minute questions as a routine standard for major operations as well as the consultation.Its always better to review any questions or issues you may have well before the day of surgery.When reviewing before and after pictures with plastic surgeons during consultations I recommend patients encourage the provider to open up their portfolio and show their entire collection of before and after pictures. Being shown a few sample pictures which most likely represent the best results of the providers career is insufficient to get a clear understanding of what average results look like or what results will look like on someone with your characteristics. This is why patients should bring pictures of their own bodies with them during consultations and ask the providers to show as many pictures as possible I patience with similar body characteristics. Its also a good idea to ask surgeons to show examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and less than outcomes. an experienced surgeon should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures for commonly perform procedures like a full tummy tuck. Highly experienced surgeons will have hundreds or even thousands of before and after pictures of commonly performed procedures.When in doubt contact your surgeon well in advance of the date of surgery.Youre most likely paying a substantial amount of money for your procedure and that fee includes all of the pre-and postop visits.Be a good consumer and get your moneys worth by making sure all your questions have been answered before the procedure.The outcome of a full tummy tuck is more or less permanent and a reversible.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Can you bring wish pictures on the day of surgery or the surgeon already has a plan?",/question/bring-pictures-day-surgery-surgeon-plan

This fluid was not clinically detectable by palpation or inspection and resulted in no need for seroma aspiration or any complication. The total amount of fluid associated with clinical complications including drainage in the other groupswas greater than 80 cc, and the total amount of non-clinically detectablefluid in the progressive-tension group was always 80 cc or less. The use of drains plus progressive tension sutures did not change the amount of fluid, so there is really no benefit to using drains plus progressive tensionsutures.  The study was discussed by Pollock and Pollock, who noted that in their series of 565 patients using progressive tension sutures they never had a clinically significant seroma. When a seroma occurs, it may require multiple visits and aspirations, and if persistent, introduction of antibiotic sclerosing solutions, or reoperation to remove a fluid filled fibrous cavity.The drain opening may leave a scar in the incision or pubic mons which may become pigmented or depressed. Not having to use drains spares the patient and plastic surgeon from the chance of these undesirable events and/or outcomes.  My experience mirrors that of Drs. Pollack. I have had no clinically significant seromaswhile using progressive tension sutures in the past five years or so.  Rather than use the 15-20 individually-placed sutures described by Drs.Pollock, I completely close the dead space with continuous PDO and monoderm Quill sutures. These sutures effectively reduce the dead space to almost nothing, so even the small amount of fluid that might collect between the sutures, cannot create any significant seroma. Using running Quill sutures allows relatively rapid dead space closure as no knot-tying is needed. The umbilical location is confirmed with a Lockwood flap marker before the lower abdominal closure is completed.","Robert M.

PERSONALIZED - similar to the art approach it is purely subjective instead of analytic - - I like it VS I do not like this . - I THINK I look like her so...THIS is what I am going to look like. ANALYTIC / DETACHED - A much better appreciation of a surgeon's work is derived from a careful observation;  - the pictures are early (ie no long-term results which better demonstrate results) or long-term results. - The patient is thin vs. obese with - normal vs. sun damaged skin, - minimal pooch  vs. large degree of tummy laxity, - the Mons pubis was / was not droopy, - the amount of waist / hip / tummy contouring were poor, average, good or excellent. I think the latter systematic approach, once adopted, tend to confuse you less and better educate you on what to look for. You can also ask plastic surgeons to show you on their pictures what they consider an acceptable, good or great result. Some would not answer but many would.Hope this helps.Dr. P. Aldea","Peter A.

The likelihood that you, or anyone else, will be able to notice a significant difference between a 350 Mod Plus and 375 High Profile is slim. You are over analyzing which implant is best for you, and this is ultimately the role of your plastic surgeon. YOUR very important role, is to communicate with your plastic surgeon, as you have with Real Self, your exact goals, with pictures, etc. Your plastic surgeon will carefully measure and deicide which implant is most likely to achieve your final result.In my own practice, I use sizers during surgery, and I bring your ideal photos to the operating room with me. The sizers are way to very precisely determine which implant brings you closest to your ideal.Be sure that your own aesthetics align with those of your plastic surgeon.Words or letters as in cup size or not too big ornatural, are notoriously inaccurate and variable, depending on an individual's post of view. A visual understanding of what you hope to look like is essential.This can be accomplished either with photographs of patients whose breasts andbody type look like you, or ideally with photos of patients not only whose breastsand body type visually are similar to yours, but are also a similar height,weight, and pre-operative breast size. In our own practice we have providedthat unique functionality on our website to accomplish exactly that.  Unfortunately the most common reason for a woman to beunhappy after her augmentation is feeling as though she is either too big ornot big enough. Thankfully, in our practice this is rarely a problem becauseimplant size selection is what we spend most of our time discussing anddetermining. I do not place the onus of selecting the breast implant size on mypatients since they are coming to me for my advice and expertise, but I do askmy patients to be as specific as possible about their aesthetic goals and I thenadvise them accordingly.  I would advise you to seek the advice of a board certifiedplastic surgeon experienced in breast enhancement surgery and make sure thatyour own sense of aesthetics aligns with that of your plastic surgeon. Youridea of natural or pretty or proportionate might be different from yourplastic surgeons and it is very important for you to feel confident that youare both of like minds as far as the goals.

	Skin Tightening Lasers- Do Not Get Caught Up In Brand Names

	&nbsp;

	First of all you should ask -Do they really work? I would urge you to find a responsible and knowledgable plastic surgeon and not focus on brand names as this is the least important part of your decision.&nbsp; As far as longevity- the six week results of your intervention are as permanent as anything in your body can be.&nbsp; you will continue to age depending on your genetics and environmental factors.

	The problem with noninvasive skin tightening is that everyone wants it and everyone wants to believe it works.&nbsp; The result is practitioners of all sorts capitalizing on this demand.&nbsp; The truth about skin tightening interventions is that almost all of them work AND NONE OF THEM WORK.&nbsp; What I mean by this is that there are many ways to convert energy into heat inside or below the skin causing contraction.&nbsp; The problem is that to deliver clinically effective results the tissue needs to reach at a minimum 43 C which is uncomfortable and can be scary for the patient and the practitioner.&nbsp; This often results in ineffective treatment and wasted time and money.&nbsp; I have developed extensive experience with noninvasive technologies mot because I'm a fan but because my patients demand it.&nbsp; After using several best in class technologies to deliver definitive results, my patients were relatively pleased but I was underwhelmed.&nbsp; THis is why I started using&nbsp; a treatment that we call Maerckks Multimodal Therapy(MMT) in my practice.&nbsp; All this is is an intelligently designed multitechnology treatment customized for the individual patient.&nbsp; I use multiple diffferent frequencies and administration systems for radiofrequency delivery, three different ultrasound frequencies, infrared pulsed light, two different laser systems in concert to deliver immediate significant results that are hard to argue with and continue improving for weeks.&nbsp; I think the only way to get real results is to combine technologies under the direction of a plastic surgeon that understands the capabilities and limitations of noninvasive skin tightening.&nbsp; No one technology really delivers anything significant.&nbsp; Also realiize that even my MMT results that I am very proud of do not remotely compare to what I can achieve with surgery and the cost can approach or exceed that of surgery depending on location and individual patient findings

12373939,question,,"I appreciate your attempt at including before and after pictures. It is however far better when it comes to making an assessment to do so using quality images. Ask your surgeon to forward your before and after pictures and use those for reference when it comes to making an assessment of your outcome.The fullness in your lower abdomen it needs to be checked to make sure it is a fluid buildup.A fluid buildup called a seroma happens if drains are not used or if drains are removed too soon.You can often diagnose a fluid collection because its like a bag of water or waterbed mattress. you push one area and the other area expands.It can also be diagnosed using an ultrasound.If its a fluid collection then its a little too late to treat it effectively without surgery.Based on your pictures you probably needed an extended tummy tuck or more aggressive liposuction on your sides.Plastic surgeons often do some liposuction in conjunction with a tummy tuck.To treat the hips waist and back appropriately patients need to be turned either on their side or face down.Most plastic surgeons will not go through the process of turning a patient during surgery unless absolutely necessary.If done in conjunction with a tummy tuck the liposuction needs to be done first because after the tummy tuck its not possible for the patient to lay on their abdomen.Turning a patient under general anesthesia is cumbersome and not particularly popular with the nursing staff or anesthesiologist.It can take 30 minutes or longer and typically requires six personnel to turn a patient safely in the operating room.For that reason most surgeons do liposuction with patients laying on their back which significantly hampers the ability to contour the torso correctly.There are also some safety concerns regarding blood supply when doing aggressive liposuction in conjunction with a full tummy tuck.To get your torso looking proportionate without your current dog ears(that is the correct medical Termanology for fullness at the end of the incision) you will need revision surgery.Most likely your incision will need to be extended in combination with Liposuction.Its possible that the contour can be improved with liposuction alone or just skin excision.Ideally the extent of the tummy tuck shouldve been predicted and described before surgery during an in person consultation. An experienced and talented surgeon should not be leaving dog ears. A good surgeon will assess the patient accurately and know when an extended tummy tuck is indicated.The outcome of your procedure probably represents a standard or average outcome by average surgical skills in the United States.Ending up with dog ears is not at all uncommon so there is no evidence of inappropriate surgery or gross lack of competence. top-notch plastic surgeons typically dont leave dog ears. An extended tummy tuck also requires turning the patient during surgery and typically the backside is treated first then the patient is again turn onto their back at which time the main tummy tuck is completed on the front of the abdomen. An extended tummy tuck can be called a partial wraparound, partial body lift, semi circumferential tummy tuck etc etc. The concept being that individuals who have skin laxity that continues beyond just the front of their abdomen will need a skin excision that goes beyond the hips.Im not a fan of virtual consultations regardless how thorough both patient and surgeon attempts at being.Theres simply no substitute for an in person consultation in order to get an accurate assessment and for the patient to properly vet the provider.My recommended way of choosing a plastic surgeon for a tummy tuck is the first schedule multiple in person consultations staying local whenever possible.During each consultation ask each provider to open up the portfolio and show you their entire collection of before and after pictures.Surges may be apprehensive to do that but patients should be persistent they want to see as many pictures as possible especially of patients who have similar body characteristics to your own.Ask the surgeon to show examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and less than outcomes.Ask specifically about the surgeons revision rate and what your policies are regarding revision surgery.Ask each surgeon to show you examples of patients who needed revisions and what they look like before and after.Surgeons make it slightly annoyed at patients telling them what to do but you need to be in the driver seat since youre the one paying for the procedure and will end up with the results. patients should take vetting of plastic surgeons seriously. You are in the end responsible for the choice of surgeon which has an immense impact on the potential outcome.There are major differences in outcomes among different providers in the field of plastic surgery.Simply being board-certified and plastic surgery with an overall good reputation is insufficient to confirm someone has mastered anyone a procedure. When reviewing pictures bring with you pictures of your own torso so with the views from all side so you can compare and find other patients who have similar characteristics.When reviewing results look very carefully at who gets the most natural looking belly buttons on a consistent basis as well as a very low set scar preferably with a slightly convex incision over the mons pubis with the scar following anatomic contours naturally and evenly on both sides. ideally the scar should be set in the groin crease. make sure the torso looks balanced proportionate and attractive from all angles including from behind.This is the time to discuss indications for modifications of the procedure such as the need for an extended tummy tuck or additional liposuction.Patient should have a clear understanding if the surgeon is planning on turning them in the operating room or doing all of the surgery with the patients laying on their back.Patients need to have a clear understanding that without turning their body during surgery the surgeon is inherently limited in what they can accomplish when it comes to the extent of surgery and doing quality liposuction.An experienced surgeon should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures. Highly experienced surgeons will have hundreds or even thousands of before and after pictures of commonly performed procedures like a full tummy tuck.Finally I recommend patients read all reviews on various physician review websites avoiding providers with any significant number of justified negative reviews.The absence of justified negative reviews is more important and more telling than having an abundance of positive reviews.Patients should be familiar with what before and after pictures look like and what a quality tummy tuck results should look like before the consultation.This includes all the above stated variables such as a natural looking belly button, Lois that scar, Esquire that follows anatomic contours naturally and his even on both sides with a Torso looking balanced and proportion it from all angles.Devise a rating scale and score 8 surgeons results based on your own ratings and make notes of why or why not you like the outcomes of each provider you consult with.When in doubt slow down and schedule more consultations.A full tummy tuck as a permanent and more or less irreversible procedure. Certain things can definitely be improved upon and in your case your outcome will need a revision to be at its best and there are no inherent limitations based on what was done.In other instances if the belly button doesnt come out looking good its often very difficult to improve once the procedure is performed.Patients to travel for surgery should expect to travel for their follow up. Your surgeon needs to address the fullness on your lower abdomen and confirm its not a fluid collection.If it is it will need to be treated surgically.Your surgeon is responsible for your outcome and you are responsible for choosing that surgeon.Its highly unlikely some thing ruptured or any particular thing went wrong but the phone is either A direct reflection of how the procedure was performed or could represent a fluid collection called a seroma.I recommend you have an in person follow up with your surgeon at which time you can review all of your concerns and talk about revision surgery.Ideally all plastic surgeons should talk about the revision policy during consultations for any surgical procedure so patients are well informed.Most surgeons do not charge for revision surgery but its often asked the patients pay for facilities such as operating rooms and anesthesia fees if needed for revision surgery.Some plastic surgeons will do revision work included more extensive revision work as an office based procedure while others will do it in a formal operating room.Each surgeon has their own way of practicing medicine and decides how best to care for their patients and run their practice.At seven months your results are final with the exception of how your scar looks. theres probably very little swelling at this point and the contour of your body will not change by waiting further. The scar and how it appears will continue for to change and most likely improve for an additional year. Skin incisions can take 18 months before they are mature.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: 7 months post TT, asymmetry in hips and lump by incision.

1855593,question,,"&nbsp; The minimum time need to recover after a mommy maker over, the short answer is 6 weeks. &nbsp;&nbsp;Recovery time after any surgery will vary from patient to patientbased on a number of different factors. Since a mom he make over refers to a number of different operations itwill just depend on which ones are done.  Remember a mommy make overtypically refers to an operation that improves the look and shape of a woman'sbreasts. At the same time it also deals with contouring of the abdominal wall. The breast operations that could be done include; a breast augmentation,a breast lift, breast reduction, or breast lift with the addition of breastimplants.  As far as the abdomen goes the operations could include;liposuction only, a mini tummy tuck, full tummy tuck, tummy tuck withliposuction or a lipo-abdominoplasty.  Typically the breast surgeriesdon't have much more than 7-10 days of general recovery, with restrictions onhigh impact activities up to 6 weeks.  For most of my patients they findthat the breast operations are comfortable enough were more than a day or 2 ofpain medicines is not necessary.  The abdominal procedures on the otherhand are where most of the recovery comes from.  For my tummy tuckpatient's, including those that have a Mommy make over, I typically tell themthat they will need between 2 and 3 weeks of general recovery.  Again noheavy lifting or high impact activity for 6 weeks is typically recommended. Ifwe think in terms of recovery there are multiple different aspects of it.  When some people talked about recovery there is simply referring to howthey will feel.  Pain, discomfort, tightness, are all aspects of this formof the recovery, So for each one of these it'll vary from patient to patient. Another aspect of recovery is returned to physical activity.  Inthis aspect of recovery it is more depend on a physiologic response which doesnot vary as much from patient to patient.   In a normal patient who is notdiabetic, protein malnourished, a smoker, or on steroids,  they can expect50% of the strength of a healing wound to be there by 6 weeks.  Thereforea lot of the restrictions that I recommend to patient's postoperatively areremoved by 6 weeks.  In the final kind of healing I talked by patient'sabout it when they will feel normal.  For most patients this could take upto 12 weeks.  With the exception of numbness that can happen in theoperative fields were this kind of recovery could really take between 15 and 18months.

Other than adding some time, and therefore some expense to the procedure, there is no downside or risk to using a drainless technique.The flap has to be sutureddown evenly without dimpling the skin, and the space needs to be closed thoroughly.

Rather than use the 15-20 individually-placed sutures described by Drs.Pollock, I completely close the dead space with continuous PDO and monoderm Quill sutures. These sutures effectively reduce the dead space to almost nothing, so even the small amount of fluid that might collect between the sutures, cannot create any significant seroma. Using running Quill sutures allows relatively rapid dead space closure as no knot-tying is needed. The umbilical location is confirmed with a Lockwood flap marker before the lower abdominal closure is completed.  ","Robert M.

You need to have the savings, tax refund, available credit, or financing. That's clear cut. Then, you need to be able to take the one week off (work, school, or being a mom) necessary for recovery. Those are arrangements you have to make for when the time comes. Now comes the question that really confuses women: do you do it now or wait until after pregnancy/another child?Do I get my breast augmentation before or after pregnancy? is one of my most frequently asked questions. PREGNANCY AND BREAST AUGMENTATION SURGERY No, pregnancy will not ruin your breast implants. Whether you have implants or not, pregnancy and breastfeeding will do things to your body. When you are pregnant, your body releases more hormones. You will gain weight. The skin will be stretched by the pregnancy weight and lose some elasticity. After childbirth, your breast will deflate and your skin will be looser. There are two major unpredictable factors surrounding these changes. First, the DEGREE that these changes (looser skin, defalting breasts) will occur is unpredictable. And second, it is unpredictable whether these changes will warrant a procedure. Therefore, it is impossible to predict whether you will need a lift after pregnancy and breastfeeding. But note that If you already have a breast augmentation, the implants will not affect those factors. The bottom line is that there is too much uncertainty to make a decision based on these possibilities. Thats why I take the following approach:When patients ask me whether they should get an augmentation now or wait, I ask them, Are you presently, proactively having sex with your partner with the purpose of getting pregnant? It's the most direct way of describing family planning.If the answer is yes, they should wait. It's a no-brainer. You should not have this surgery while pregnant, and since you're trying to get pregnant, there is a good chance it will happen soon. If the answer is no, then I give the green light. When someone vaguely anticipates having a child within the next couple of years, there is too much uncertainty there. It could happen 1 year, 2 years or 5 years from now.

Of course, the answer is Now.Recently, I had a 33-year-old patient who was a mom. I did a breast augmentation (saline, moderate profile). She went from a B to a full C cup. Looking at her post-op results, she told me how thrilled she was. She exclaimed, I wish I had met you 10 years ago!I get that so often. And I'm sure other surgeons do also. The reason for this wish is simple: patients love the way they look and feel, and wish that had experienced boost in self-esteem sooner in their lives. So technically, based on patient feedback, the best time to feel confident and beautiful is years ago. But, since we can't travel back in time, if you can afford to and are not family planning, the second best choice is now.

	RE: &quot; I am considering a mini (I do not want a full) and I do not want my muscles tightened. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a &quot;sub optimal&quot; result in the eyes of the plastic surgeon. I mainly just want to get rid of the pouch of fat and some of the skin with as little invasiveness as possible..&quot;

	Respectfully, I don&#39;t think you really understand what you are asking for. Plastic surgeons&#39; success&nbsp;depends on producing &quot;wow!!!&quot; results not &quot;I can&#39;t see the difference, dear...,or worse yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; What happened to you?&quot; or &quot;Who did that to you?&quot; results. Movies often portray as as self-absorbed artists who impose our whims and sense of beauty on weak-willed, insecure women. That is rarely if ever the case.

	In your case, I assume you want to get your full before-baby body back only better. In the hundreds of women I have treated I had a very small minority asking to remove the loose skin but leave the tummy pooch/ muffin top, wider waist and sagging mons pubis&nbsp;intact. Every woman wants the flattest tummy possible with restoration of a narrow, sexy waist. NONE of these are achievable by removing only a little loose skin under the belly button (Mini-Tummy Tuck) while ignoring the tummy muscle separation and stretched out state.

	Since Mini-Tummy Tucks produce disappointing results in almost all women who had a single large pregnancy or multiple pregnancies you will not see a lot of pictures of this procedure on the web. Such photographs would case prospective patients away from a surgeon.

	Please, reconsider your decision. See several Plastic surgeons and see what they suggest. Start by telling them what you want to look like - not what surgery you are willing to put up with.

	Hi there-

	Generally speaking, it is definitely in your best interests to avoid having to have two operations when one would suffice...

	This is the central principle guiding the answers of my colleagues below- if you think that you may have more children, wait until after the last pregnancy (or until you are confident that you will have no more) to pursue a tummy tuck.

	Becoming pregnant after your tummy tuck may necessitate having the operation re-done, at your repeat expense and risk (the risk is not greater the second time, but it is a second operation).

	On the other hand, I think I see where you are coming from- you're a single mom and would like to maximize your appearance NOW...

	It's not fair for us as plastic surgeons to say you should never date again, or that even though you are self conscious about your appearance you should not do anything about it until after your last child.

	You as an individual need to weigh the benefits and the risks of proceeding with body contour improvement now versus waiting...

	The benefits of proceeding now are that you will achieve the look you want sooner, be less self-conscious, and more confident as you re-enter the dating scene. The risks (aside from the risks of the operation in general) are that if you have another baby you may need to have the operation done again. Only you can decide whether this risk is worth it for you.

	I would add that the benefit would seem more worthwhile the longer you might enjoy it- in other words, if you know that it will be 6-8 years before you become pregnant again, the benefit of looking good now may be more worth the risk of having a second operation than if you think it will only be 2 years before you have your next baby.

	Give all of this your consideration, and when you're ready, be sure to see only a surgeon certified by The American Board of Plastic Surgery.

12357118,question,,"Scheduling depends on a multitude of variables. obviously Im not successful or busy or plastic surgery office this may have a longer wait. Before a consultation and surgery and for some surgeons operating room time may be restricted to certain block times of operating room availability.I would say theres generally some correlation with surgeons who are highly sought after with long waiting lines to simply get an appointment for a consultation and surgeries are booked out for years in advance.Some can do this with marketing alone but generally to get to that status the surgeon typically has to be above average in regards to the results and possibly have a very strong marketing machine behind them.I know plenty of very talented surgeons who have a very short waiting lines and some are not so good or poorly trained individuals doing cosmetic surgery who are quite busy.Its always easier and generally encouraged to not rush into surgical procedures and scheduled them well in advance.Early summer and spring time are typically the most popular seasons for cosmetic surgery especially procedures pertaining to young women like liposuction and breast augmentation.Tell me tuck is probably the most or one of the most intense and invasive operations we perform as plastic surgeons at least in the Aesthetic surgery arena.Theres nothing wrong with anyone having the procedure but patients should be prepared physically, emotionally, financially, and financially.For most patients two full weeks of uninterrupted recovery time is about right. A lot of people experience an emotional roller coaster during the first 12 months after a full tummy tuck.It obviously varies substantially from patient to patient and to some degree the experience varies on the choice of providers.I do not recommend anybody scheduled surgery or commit to surgery by setting a date or making a deposit during any one single consultation.I think patients oh it to themselves to think about their options and I definitely recommend patients have multiple in person consultations before committing to a permanent and irreversible procedure.When a tummy tuck is done poorly it is very difficult to improve upon the results with the revisionFor that reason I recommend anyone in doubt simply slow down and continue having in person consultations until you feel very comfortable you found the right provider.Well some surgeons may have scheduling times that are more convenient for your needs I would not choose a plastic surgeon purely based on schedule availability.Theres a substantial difference or variety/variance in tummy tuck results based on who does the procedure.Ive seen lots of plastic surgeons do these far too fast hunting quarters as they go not attempting to do their best work but simply maximize profit.A detail oriented full tummy tuck should take about four hours.Its possible surgeons can do quality work especially on a smaller patient and less time than that especially if they have an assistant.No one should need 7 to 8 hours to do a tummy tuck unless its an extended or wraparound tummy tuck and a large individual or there are secondary procedures or some unusual circumstance.The key to find the best provider is to get access to their entire collection of before and after pictures or as close to that as you can.Most providers will show you pre-selected pictures representing the best results of their career.Thats fine and we all expect people to put their best foot forward.With the cosmetic surgery its nice to see really high quality outputs but would patients really need to see is number one what average results look like in the hands of each provider and number two how many of these procedures have they really performed.To do that ask providers to open up their entire portfolio of before and after pictures. With most plastic surgeons using electronic means of storing photographs this should not be all that difficult.Surgeons may be reluctant for a variety of reasons to simply open up and let patients look at every single one of the results but if they do you should take the opportunity.To put things in perspective my personal belief is that an experienced provider should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures of commonly performed procedures like a tummy tuck. highly experienced surgeons will have hundreds or even thousands of before and after pictures for these type of procedures.Bring pictures of your own torso similar to have plastic surgeons take before and after pictures showing your front side and backside as reference for finding previous patients who had similar body characteristics to your own.Ask the surgeon to show you as many pictures as possible with patients who have similar body characteristics to your own. You should also ask them to show you examples of a variety of different types of outcomes including excellent outcomes, average outcomes and less than outcomes.You should always ask what the surgeons policy is in regards to revision Work. All plastic surgeons should have a certain revision rate. If not they are either not acknowledging that things could be done better. What outcome is less than what the surgeon had hoped for they should be encouraging Im offering revisions to improve the outcome. If the surgeon can make a substantial impact on the primary outcome a revision is indicated and should not be charged for it though it is common for plastic surgery offices to ask patients to pay for any facility or anesthesia fee should they be needed.In reality a lot of revision work are fairly minor details and can often be done in the office avoiding the expense of a formal operating room with an anesthesiologist.Judge plastic surgeons for tummy tuck surgery based on who gets the most natural looking belly buttons. That tends to be one of the harder parts of the procedure and those who get natural looking belly buttons typically know what youre doing. You should be very familiar with what tummy tuck results look like finding as many before and after pictures on various websites and forums like this especially of patients who have your body characteristic.Set up a reading system for it various criteria you use to vet providers.The tummy tuck and how natural it looks its probably one of the best. The second variable the differentiates quality work from that which is perhaps not such nice looking outcomes is the design of the incision. in my opinion there should be a convex curvature following the natural curve of the mons pubis. after that the scar or incision line should follow the groin crease. Setting the scar very low allows patients to camouflage the scar nicely with undergarments and also creates the illusion of an elongated torso.The torso should also look balanced and proportionate from all areas. Simply viewing a tummy tuck by only judging the front of the abdomen is not sufficient. A good plastic surgeon will see the torso from all angles and modify the procedure so that the torso looks good from all angles after the procedure. this means for some individuals it may require doing an extended tummy tuck including sometimes doing wraparound or body lift type procedures. for others as simply adding appropriate body contouring with Liposuction or whatever is needed to have the torso look attractive balanced and proportionate from all angles.Plastic surgeons rarely do but they should include pictures from the front, sides including the back as well as three-quarter views.Finally I recommend reading all reviews and various physician review websites avoiding providers with any significant number of justified negative reviews. The absence of justified negative reviews is more important in more telling than having an abundance of positive reviews.Its not uncommon for people to want to take advantage of scheduling surgery around time off which includes some of the holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas time.In some offices those slots may be difficult to obtain and for other practices they may be wide-open.You should be aware that surgical schedules are quite dynamic and change often sometimes on the short notice.Life happens and patients sometimes cancel surgery right up until the day of surgery.If its important to get your procedure done sooner rather than later then ask to get on their waiting list and let them know that the time frame is important for you.It may be tempting to choose the surgeon who is most convenient in regards to scheduling but I would always recommend patients choose providers purely based on skill, experience, ethical values and a sense of trust.Whenever possible I recommend patients avoid virtual consultations. I dont think its possible to get a good quality assessment and explain what can or cannot be accomplished or the new one says and variations without an examination. Likewise I dont think patients can properly vet a provider and get a good sense of who they are. Its also difficult to convey what I mentioned earlier about getting doctors to open up their portfolio and show as many before and after pictures if the pictures need to be sent via email or uploaded etc. etc. In the end finding the right plastic surgeon is the most important variable and doing that requires a fair amount of effort for most people.Sometimes people simply stumble upon one of the best surgeons during their first consultation.Being a board-certified plastic surgeon with overall good reputation is no guarantee that any plastic surgeon has mastered any one particular procedure.In regards to simply understanding each surgeons office scheduling and timelines you can probably get that information by calling the front office and asking how far office is booked out when their next surgical and consultation appointments are available and if they have a list for patients willing to take a surgery spot on short notice.A full tummy tuck including muscle tightening is a major operation and patients typically do better if they are well prepared physically, emotionally, socially and financially.A lot of individuals go through a roller coaster of emotions for months after the surgery.It makes it much easier if you have solid social support in your life going through this process rather than relationships with conflict or close friends and family not supporting the individual for having the procedure.Continue having consultations until you feel very confident you found the right provider for your needs.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Scheduling for certain time of year - how far out do hospitals/surgeons normally schedule?",/question/ardmore-pennsylvania-scheduling-time-year

	CBC: A commonly used abbreviation in medicine that stands for complete blood count, a set values of the cellular (formed elements) of blood. These measurements are generally determined by specially designed machines that analyze the different components of blood in less than a minute.

	The values generally included are the following:

	White blood cell count (WBC). The number of white blood cells in a volume of blood. Normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4,300 and 10,800 cells per cubic millimeter (cmm). This can also be referred to as the leukocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.3 - 10.8 x 109 cells per liter.
	Automated white cell differential. A machine generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells, usually split into granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.
	Red cell count (RBC). The number of red blood cells in a volume of blood. Normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4.2 - 5.9 million cells/cmm. This can also be referred to as the erythrocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.2 - 5.9 x 1012 cells per liter.&nbsp;
	Hemoglobin (Hb). The amount of hemoglobin in a volume of blood. Hemoglobin is the protein molecule within red blood cells that carries oxygen and gives blood its red color. Normal range for hemoglobin is different between the sexes and is approximately 13 - 18 grams per deciliter for men and 12 - 16 for women (international units 8.1 - 11.2 millimoles/liter for men, 7.4 - 9.9 for women).
	Hematocrit (Hct). The ratio of the volume of red cells to the volume of whole blood. Normal range for hematocrit is different between the sexes and is approximately 45 - 52% for men and 37 - 48% for women.
	Mean cell volume (MCV). The average volume of a red cell. This is a calculated value derived from the hematocrit and red cell count. Normal range is 86 - 98 femtoliters.
	Mean cell hemoglobin (MCH). The average amount of hemoglobin in the average red cell. This is a calculated value derived from the measurement of hemoglobin and the red cell count. Normal range is 27 - 32 picograms.
	Mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). The average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of red cells. This is a calculated volume derived from the hemoglobin measurement and the hematocrit. Normal range is 32 - 36%.
	Red cell distribution width (RDW). A measurement of the variability of red cell size. Higher numbers indicate greater variation in size. Normal range is 11 - 15.
	Platelet count. The number of platelets in a volume blood. Platelets are not complete cells, but actually fragments of cytoplasm from a cell found in the bone marrow called a megakaryocyte. Platelets play a vital role in blood clotting. Normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is in the range of 150,000 - 400,000/ cmm (150 - 400 x 109/liter).

	In a surgery the important issue is anemia and clotting that a recent, less than 3 weeks old, CBC demonstrates. As for the low K+ this could be a sign of cardiac issues and needs to be resolved. The low thyroid test may have an effect on healing. So a pre operative work up is the correct course to follow to be sure you are medically cleared to have a surgery.&nbsp;

The first week and a half is not a time or you should plan on doing any physical activities. This means no childcare, no housecleaning no errands. you should have someone by your side for the first three days.The recovery is often explained this way.Day 1-2, These days Are pretty horrific and patients are basically laying still and taking around the clock narcotic pain medication. I no longer perform this procedure but when I did I had my patients spend the first day in the hospital or recovery room setting.Day 3, on the third day things get better. This is consistent with almost every patient who goes through the procedure. At this Point patients realize that each day will get easier and it makes recovery emotionally and physicallyacceptable.Day 5-7, At this time the pain is much better and patients can get up and possibly even get outside a little bit. By this time abdominal pain is tolerable and some patients are off narcotic pain medication. At this time the drains become more irritating and are often the main concern for patients.Day 10, this is typically around the time that the drains come out. Patients feel a sense of relief not being connected to rubber tubes. I called the big blow to freedom.14-20 Days, During this time patients are getting back to normal activities like work and daily responsibilities. Often things have gotten piled up during the recovery time. Results look awkward and youre still not used to all the changes in your body. Its still hard to stand up straight. Certain movements still cost pain but its tolerable.4-6 weeks, During this time youre getting used to your new body. The numbness isnt so strange anymore and patients can begin unrestricted exercise. Results still look a little off and the scar doesnt look so great.6 moths. Youre not used to your body, the numbness seems like normal and youve excepted that its just how things are going to be.

12373542,question,,"There are advantages and disadvantages of going to specialty clinics. Doctors who work for clinics that do the same procedure over and over tend to have far more experience than those who do general plastic surgery.The corporate for-profit model is also not necessarily functioning as a source a patient advocacy.Still, some of the surgeons who work for liposuction chains have tenfold more liposuction experience than those in plastic surgery who occasionally do liposuction.To make an assessment on the outcome of your procedure we always need to see before and after pictures.Not knowing what you look like before tells us nothing about the change that was created.If you dont have proper before and after pictures then ask your surgeon or your fast food clinic to forward the pictures they took. They are part of your medical records would you have a legal right to.Simply ask them to forward all your medical records including all before and after pictures taken.They can legally ask you to pay a small fee for copying paper and sending them but it should be no more than $10-$15.If you want someone to give you an assessment youll need to show before and after pictures.Based on your picture it looks like you were a better candidate for a tummy tuck and liposuction in the first place. You have significant skin laxity and most likely muscle separation.With fat removal your skin dropped further and is holding over your belly button.Nobody has swelling one year after liposuction. It simply doesnt happen.Results are final by about three months after the procedure and are unlikely to change beyond that.Weight fluctuations can definitely impact results significantly for the better or for the worst.Try lifting up on your skin on your upper abdomen and see if the contour area changes.Putting the skin under tension is a good way to assess the underlying subcutaneous fat and the contour of your abdominal wall.If youre done having children then converting your procedure to a full tummy tuck is the right procedure not because you had previous liposuction but because a tummy tuck was the right procedure in the first place.Overall your skin looks smooth and even and I see no skin contour irregularities anywhere. To me it looks like someone performed quality liposuction on your abdomen who knew what they were doing but you unfortunately may not have been a great candidate for Liposuction.At that corporate fast food chain model they may be reluctant to tell you these things since they often have commission sales people.I dont think your surgeon did a bad job at all and I think your results can easily be explained but your post gives limited information and whats needed is an examination and in person second opinion consultation.To get a second opinion consultation regarding the outcome of your Liposuction or to discuss further surgery to improve your abdomen I suggest scheduling those with local board-certified plastic surgeons in your community. for a second opinion consultations to patients should come prepared with a copy of their operative report and before and after pictures. Like previously mentioned those are available from your previous clinic upon request.If youre considering moving forward with a tummy tuck then vent the surgeons properly to find the most skilled and talented provider.Do that by having multiple in person consultations. During each consultation ask each provider to open up their portfolio and show you the entire collection of before and after pictures for tummy tuck surgery. Some plastic surgeons may be reluctant to do that but you should still ask them to show you as many pictures as they can. You should especially ask to see as many pictures as possible of patients with similar body characteristics to your own.Bring pictures of your own torso with pictures taken from the front, side and back with you for comparison when reviewing before and after pictures.The hallmark of a quality tummy tuck tends to be consistent natural looking belly buttons. Second so that would be a very low set scar with a slightly convex curvature over the mons pubis with a scar following anatomic contours naturally and evenly on both sides and finally the torso looking balanced attractive and appropriate from all angles including from behind.A full tummy tuck should be considered when women are quite certain they are done having children.Finally I recommend reading all reviews on various physician review websites avoiding providers with any significant number of justified negative reviews. The absence of justified negative reviews is more important and more telling than having an abundance of positive reviews.The largest Liposuction company in the world is called sono bello. I believe they have clinics in your community. The company is notorious for unethical business practices. The companies reputation speaks for itself if you review reviews on websites like yelp.That said the company has also hired some upstanding and very talented surgeons and some that are not so talented.There are certain advantages and disadvantages of going to a clinic that specializes in a certain procedure.

1434899,question,,"Hi and thnaks for your question. First, let me just say that I feel it's inappropriate for a surgeon to state that ypu have a very unfeminine face. What constitutes feminity? He or she could have said that your facial features could be more refined. From your photos I would disagree with the feminine evaluation. Howver, I do agree that a rhinoplasty could make you have a more refined look. Undersatnd that symmmetry in the human being does not exists. All of us have facial asymmetry, some more, some less.Your skin is a bit thick and appears to have a fair amount of sebaceous/oily glands. This type of skin always make a higher degree of nasal refinememnt mor challenging. I like to give the following analogy; Suppose we have a beautiful sculpture and subsequently cover it with a piece of silk. Even though it's covered you can still make out the sillouhette underneath the silk. Now we cover it with wool blanket. Although you may still be able to appreciate the contours of the sculpture, the definiton lacks when comoared to the silk cover.I would also caution you to pick out noses from celebrities. It's impossible to reproduce all of the features. You need to have realistic goals for your face.You need to seek the advise of a board certified surgeon with plenty of experience. Remember this is your face....can't cover it up! Furthermore request to see before and after photos of previous patients by that doctor....not a clinic or surgery center. Do your homework......research and verify the doctor's credentials. Have they had problems with the Board of Medicine, disciplinary or otherwise. Any law suits?How about the center, clinic or facility? Are they accredited by a national organization or do they just have State approval. Understand that at the current time, there are three nationally recognized organizations responsible for the highest levels of patient safety, AAAASF, AAACH and JCHO. You owe it to yourself to position yourself for the best possible results but under the most stringent safety regulations, If you have kids, even more so.How about anesthesia? Will you have a medical doctor certified by the American Board of Anesthesiology or a certified nurse anesthetist (CRNA)? Understand that there is no substitute for research. Cosmetic surgery, no matter how simple it may be to the patients, are invasive procedures and as such carry certain risks and complications.In our office we use TouchMD which is a web based program in which patients have the ability to load their picture unto the program. We accomodate patinets from as far away as California. I then evaluate them and can actually draw on the picture to show a potential patient where the incisions would be located and how the procedure is to be realized. It's all done to comply with HIPPA which is the federal law that protects the patient's medical information. Look them up.Give yourself the highest percentage of a sucssesful operation.

12373996,question,,"Pression from pregnancy cannot be corrected with strength training. The muscles them selves are unchanged from pregnancy related changes. It is the fascia or the covering of the muscle that is stretched and the position of the muscle in relationship to each other is the problem not the muscles themselves.For this reason there is no possible way to correct abdominal muscle separation related to pregnancy with any procedure other than a full tummy tuck.Surgeons have attempted to do the procedure internally to a laparoscopic surgery but the results are not very good.A full tummy tuck primarily treats muscle separation and skin laxity. Some patients have one but not the other and some patients have both and some havent neither.If you want to type flat abdomen do you need a full tummy tuck and theres no other way to do it.You cant improve the outcome from muscle training because the problem is not related to muscle. pulled muscle separation but the problem is not in the muscle but rather in the muscle fascia.No one has to have a full tummy tuck. Buddy wants to have a full tummy tuck. It is however whats required to get a tight flat abdomen.For patients that are uncertain about their decision or apprehensive about surgical intervention I recommend you simply wait until the problem bothers you enough that you are motivated to have the correct procedure.There are no alternate procedures that will correct your problem.. If there were we wouldnt be doing tummy tucks.If you decide to move forward and consider having a tummy tuck I have the following recommendations.To find the best provider increasing likelihood of having a positive overall experience I recommend patience start by having multiple in person consultations staying with local board-certified plastic surgeons whenever possible.During each consultation ask each provider to open up their portfolios and show you their entire collection of before and after pictures for the procedure youre interested in.Ask the provider to specifically show as many pictures as possible of patients with similar body characteristics to your own. In your case slim women with significant muscle separation with fairly tight skin.An experience provider should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures of commonly performed procedures like a full tummy tuck. ask the provider to show you examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and less than outcomes. Talk to each surgeon about the revision rate and what their policy is for patients who end up needing revision surgery.The most common indication for revisions after this procedure is in adequate skin removal in patients who have extensive skin laxity.The second reason is typically related to patients being unhappy with the appearance of their belly button.When reviewing the pictures judge results specifically based on who gets the most natural looking belly buttons on a consistent basis.Getting the belly buttons to look natural is one of the harder parts of the procedure and surgeons who get that right typically get all aspects of the procedure correct.Other characteristics of quality work include a very low set scar with a slightly convex curvature of the incision over the mons pubis. The incision should follow anatomic contours naturally being even on both sides. The torso should look attractive, balanced and appropriate from all angles including from behind.Dont surgeons based on what the scar itself looks like since that its related to how each person heals individually as well as the number of months after surgery pictures are taken. surgeons have a little control over how an individual heals but have full control over the design and position of the scar.Bring pictures of your own torso taken just like plastic surgeons take before and after pictures showing the front side and back side for reference when reviewing before and after pictures during the consultation.Get familiar with what tummy tuck results look like so you can identify quality work and come up with a grading system or reading system to differentiate the quality outcomes of each provider you consult with.Make a note of how thorough each surgeon is in regards to reviewing the entire process including preparation for surgery and recovery.Finally I recommend patient to read all reviews on various physician review websites avoiding providers with any significant number of justified negative reviews.The absence of justified negative reviews is more important and more telling than having an abundance of positive reviews.Continue having consultations until you feel very comfortable you found the most talented and experienced surgeon who meets your needs and criteria as a quality provider.Theres no set number of consultations needed. Sometimes people stumble upon the right provider during their first consultation but I recommend patients start with a minimum of five in person consultations and continue scheduling more if they have any concerns.When in doubt slow down and schedule more consultations.You will learn a lot during the process and youll become a far better patient and consumer of cosmetic surgery by doing so.If you decide to move forward with the procedure make sure you are fully prepared physically, emotionally, socially and financially.Most patients require two full weeks of recovery time without commitment to significant daily activities.The first three days are physically very challenging with most patients needing around the clock narcotic pain control. most patients will get severely constipated during the first 3 to 5 days from the use of narcotic pain medication.Have a plan in action to manage this or discuss with the surgeon during consultation.Recovery becomes tolerable on the third day at which point it gets easier every day. most surgeons will use drains which tend to become more and more obnoxious and annoying as the days go by. Drains can stay in for as long as two weeks or longer.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Will a tummy tuck tighten muscles in the lower abdomen?

I routinely use progressive tension sutures which completely close off the dead space, with the result that there is no clinically detectable or significant seroma or fluid collection.This results in rapid adherence of the flap to the abdominal wall, and no concern that early ambulation and movement will result in shearing that opens a space for fluid to collect.

636571,question,,"
	I am sorry to hear of your difficult and challenging surgical course and recovery, and am glad your'e healed and able to ask about a better cosmetic result. Knowing what you do now, perhaps either you, or your surgeon, or both would consider doing one or more things differently.

	Most surgeons I know, myself included, have a re-do or revisonary surgery policy that is discussed prior to any patient's initial surgery. Often it is printed on your quote sheet and/or consent form. Certainly you know you did not pay for two operations with your initial surgical fee quote in case you needed secondary surgery for any reason--the vast majority of patients would not be interested in paying for something they rarely would need, and nobody assumes THEY will be the one with the problem and re-operative need or request!

	Thus, every patient gets the one-operation price, and there is (hopefully) a written policy about those times another surgery is necessary or desired, as in your case.

	Then, there is the issue of fault that is the elephant in the revisionary surgery room when it comes to discussing who pays for what.

	If your surgeon used poor judgement and damaged the blood supply to the abdominal skin that caused the fat necrosis that led to the seroma, that became infected, and that aggravated the puckered healing you now have, whose fault is that? Yours, for choosing a surgeon with less-than-perfect judgement, or the surgeon, for trying to give you the best result possible and over-doing by just enough to start the unfortunate chain of events?

	Or, did you choose a non-ABPS-certified cosmetic surgeon with little or no training in plastic surgery (often because of a lower cost)? Or did you go out-of-country for that cosmetic surgery vacation experience and end up with a surgeon who was not even available for treatment of complications? Perhaps you were a smoker who did not stop, or sneaked just one or two. or were exposed to second-hand smoke! If that was the case, it must have been your surgeon's fault for not telling you how truly serious this recommendation was, or you would have followed it!

	Wow, that's an awful lot of potential finger-pointing going on! And trust me, it happens. So, assuming you did choose a reputable ABPS-certified plastic surgeon with excellent credentials and experience, and you followed ALL of your surgeon's recommendations to maximize your outcome and minimize your potential complications (activity restrictions, tobacco avoidance, garment/compression, cleanliness, etc.), and your surgeon did the best operation s/he was capable of--then&nbsp;your problems were&nbsp;really nobody's FAULT.

	It certainly sounds as if your surgeon put in much more time and effort during your recovery (as did you, we certainly understand) than with the usual no-problem patient. Presumably, s/he did that without additional fee-for service, and&nbsp;you definitely&nbsp;had to spend $$ and time for doctor's visits, hyperbaric O2, bandages, and time off work or social activities. Truly, nobody sounds like a winner here.

	And your doctor DID successfully get you healed so that you're around to be concerned about the cosmetic result both of you hoped for in the first place.

	Bottom line here: both you and your surgeon have a stake in your final result. I would be almost certain your surgeon will re-operate to try to improve your result for no additional surgeon's fee. His/her time is worth significant $$, and that is what your surgeon contributes to your improved outcome in light of this spectacularly unfortunate and thankfully rare scenario. Your contribution to that improved outcome is your agreement to cover the surgical costs (operating room; anesthesia; supplies; and, of course, another recovery and all that entails). That is what most of us would do, and although that may seem unfair to someone who paid for surgery and had to go through what you did, it is ultimately the fairest, unless there are extenuating circumstances that we online consultants cannot be aware of (but that you and your surgeon ARE). Realize that this payment plan&nbsp;for revision surgery would be true even if your surgeon operates their own surgical facility. There are still costs, though they may be better controlled in this non-hospital setting.

	One final comment while I'm on a roll: your surgical fees are paid for the performance of an operation (with all the skill, attentiveness, experience, and care your surgeon brings to bear on your behalf), NOT for a promised result or guaranteed outcome. Your surgeon did perform that procedure (and cared for you during the extended and difficult recovery), and you both were the unfortunate victims of a bad outcome. (There are worse ones, such as Kanye West's mom, so perhaps a bit of thankfulness is proper here, as I'm sure you know.)

	If there was true negligence or malpractice that can be proven in a court of law, then that is a final avenue to travel down. But poor outcomes, complications, and even bad judgment is not malpractice, so the legal medical malpractice bar is pretty high.

	If you communicate with your surgeon in a calm, reasonable, and non-accusatory manner, s/he will likely bend over backwards to make revisionary surgery as effective and cost-conscious as possible. But frankly, it is probably unreasonable to ask your surgeon to not only do free surgery and get you through another recovery, but also to pay for your OR, anesthesia, and other costs as well. (Small revision under local anesthesia--easy: no charge. But more surgery and full anesthesia is a different story.

	Thanks for asking in such a non-blaming way, and please understand that I was simply using examples in my discussion above, and truly NOT pointing the blame finger towards you in any way. Individual patients may see certain aspects of my discussion in themselves, just as my surgical colleagues and I do in the surgical part. You see, if we've been doing this for a few years, we've all been there or in similar shoes once or twice! God bless, and best wishes!

12439212,question,,"It is possible to remove fat from one part of the body and graft fat in the other parts of your body.Its not quite as simple as working with Play-Doh.Grafting tissue is a fairly complex procedure that comes with a substantial amount of it in precision and requires skill and experience.Most individuals facial aesthetic make up is based on facial skeletal structure knots soft tissue coverageWhat differentiates individuals from each other making people recognizable including being considered attractive or less attractive, masculine or feminine is primarily based on your skull.Soft tissue coverage of the facial skeletal structure tends to be very consistent from one person to another.Facial aging is more related to soft tissues than skeletal structure but the inherent individual look each person has is almost exclusively based on bone structure not fat distribution.Because one area of your face looks bigger or smaller doesnt necessarily mean you need more or less fat in those areas.Grafting fat doesnt have the same appearance as having an appropriate sized bone structure.Instead of inventing new operations I suggest you get a quality assessment.You didnt include pictures and you didnt describe very well would you like in what you dont like.We cant really begin to make an assessment without any type of quality information.For facial assessment we need at a minimum a complete set of facial pictures. Look at how plastic surgeons take before and after pictures to get an idea. Generally the pictures need to be taken at correct angles with correct camera height showing a frontal, profile and three-quarter angle pictures from about 6 feet away without facial expressions. Depending on what your underlying ideology is you can consider consulting with plastic surgeons and or oral surgeons.There is some overlap between these two specialties. Oral surgeons and plastic surgeons both are involved with facial skeletal surgery but oral surgeons tend to see things more from the skeletal perspective well plastic surgeons tend to be more soft tissue oriented.I recognize most people are not looking to have their facial skull taken apart and replace it with titanium hardware but it is important if you want equality outcome to recognize what the underlying primary diagnosis is and I have the treatment match the actual problem.If your tires are worn out on your car then it doesnt make sense to replace the brakes. having new brakes will make sure you can stop in time but it wont do anything for eventually getting a flat tire.I suggest multiple in person consultations with local board-certified experience providers in both oral surgery and plastic surgery depending on what the underlying ideology is and what youre willing to undergo.During consultations ask each provider to show their entire collection of before and after pictures for the procedure they are recommending of previous patients with similar facial characteristics to your own.Being shown a hand full of preselected pictures of representing the best results of their career is insufficient to get a clear understanding of what average results look like or how many of these procedures theyve actually performed.Candidacy is highly related to the type of outcome so make sure the patients in the pre-op pictures have same or similar characteristics to yourself. For commonly down the procedures and experience surgeon should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 For commonly down the procedures and experience surgeon should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures.Ask providers to show you examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and outcomes I didnt turn out as well as they had hoped for. Ask each surgeon with a Revision policies and what the revision rate is.Check for thoroughness of all aspects of the consultation and take notes so you can make good comparisons from one provider to the next.Most people are not experienced a consulting with plastic surgeons well plastic surgeons have years of experience doing consultations.You need to be an advocate for yourself and take an active role in the consultation process. Do you have a job that needs to be accomplished during the concert. Its not all about show and tell from the doctor.Your job is to find out if this provider has mastered the operation youre considering having.You also have an obligation to find out that theyve made an accurate assessment or in other words a correct diagnosis.Theres sometimes different ways to achieve the same goal but youll find that when multiple providers say the same thing youre usually on the right track.When the underlying problem is based on bone structure you may hear a variety of different soft tissue solutions. This often happens when the surgeon is not focusing on the primary problem. This happens when providers dont have the skill and experience to manage facial bone related issues in regards to facial aesthetic surgery.Rearranging fat in your face may be a good procedure but its not as simple as that.That said delivering consistent quality both Liposuction and fat transfer results is more difficult than most people believe. plastic surgeons tend to think theyre better at both procedures than they actually are.Facial fat transfer is imprecise, unpredictable and cannot be unforgiving.For volume augmentation of the face using temporary fillers is a far better option.Compared to grafting fat fillers are highly predictable, very forgiving and very precise.If someone delivers a bad outcome with grafting fat in the face youre kind of stuck with the outcome.Youll be reminded several times a day for the rest of your life.With fillers the worst case scenario is that you need to have the fillers reversed or simply wait six months for them to go away.Become well-informed and do that by having multiple in person consultations.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Can facial fat be rearranged on your face?",/question/charlotte-north-carolina-facial-fat-rearranged-moved
12388096,question,,"To assess the outcome of a cosmetic surgical procedure we need to see proper before and after pictures. Liposuction results will vary based onto important variables. The first is the candidacy of the patient and the second is the skill and experience of the surgeon.Individuals with thin layers of subcutaneous fat are not going to have dramatic changes in contour from Liposuction. Consistent quality plastic surgery outcomes always begins with quality consultations.During in person consultations their individual candidacy should be assessed and proper before and after pictures should be shown giving the patient realistic expectations of what can and cannot be delivered with each procedure. Full body or high-volume liposuction procedures often stimulate people to gain weight after the procedure. Weight gain after liposuction will follow the new fat distribution which often increases visceral fat instead of subcutaneous fat.For lack of results on the front of the abdomen patients need to first and foremost make sure that the weight is proportionate to what it was before surgery minus the same amount of fat that was removed.For example, if some had a pre-procedure weighed 143 pounds and had 800 cc of fat removed their postoperative weight at six months should be 141 pounds more or less.You can talk to her surgeon about your mom fat removed and review your pre-procedure wait and compared to where you are now. Liposuction rarely delivers sufficient changes to create inches of difference in clothing size or substantial weight fluctuations.In the end low patient satisfaction from this procedure is either related to poor candidacy, poor performance, weight gain or a combination of those three.Showing a Single picture doesnt do much for assessing the outcome of the surgeryIf you dont have a proper before and after pictures then ask your provider to forward the ones they took.Most people see something resembling final results by about six weeks and my three months results are final.To get an accurate second opinion consultation I suggest scheduling those is in person consultations for the other board-certified plastic surgeons.From what you describe I believe you may have had expectations that Liposuction could deliver more than as possible and you may not have had a clear understanding regarding differentiation between subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, skin laxity and potential muscle separation if youve had previous pregnancies. Its also possible that your provider removed insufficient amounts of fat but your picture doesnt show significant amounts of fat available to be removed. Your single picture shows well defined abdominal muscle wall with very little subcutaneous fat and slight bulging of your muscle wall. The bulging of your abdomen is either related to excess visceral fat or previous pregnancies.Its important to recognize that Liposuction only treats subcutaneous fat and there are other tissue variables that contribute significantly to the contour of the abdomen.This is especially true for postpartum women.Pregnancy related changes if applicable are specifically muscle separation and skin laxity. Previous pregnancies do not change fat distribution. I dont know if you have children or not but it is a very common misconception of the patients who seek liposuction as an alternative to a full tummy tuck.Its difficult to make a quality assessment based on such limited information.To get an accurate assessment requires an in person consultation. For a second opinion consultation say recommend patients come well prepared to bring in with them all before and after pictures in a copy of your operative report. these are all part of your medical records and available if you ask for them.It is unfortunate when assessments are not done sufficiently with a thorough explanation of what a procedure can or cannot accomplish.Sometimes patients simply werent a good candidate for a certain procedure but believe that they were. Other times providers do not have sufficient skills and experience to deliver consistent quality results.Often its a combination of both.Your picture however does not show any indication of poorly done Liposuction. if anything it looks like an exceptional outcome. alternatively consider reposting with before and after pictures. If you dont have those then ask your provider to forward them.When results substantially less than what patients had anticipated it can be helpful to know that the procedure was done correctly. This requires making an assessment on the outcome of the operation. With the understanding that a patient may not have been an ideal candidate its easier to accept the outcome then living with the belief that the procedure was not done well.Managing patients who are unhappy with cosmetic surgical outcomes is a skill in itself.Dissatisfaction is best eliminated by having thorough truthful in depth in person consultations at which time quality before and after pictures that are accurate and Haily representative should be shown and limitations of the procedure should be discussed.Be cognizant of your weight because it has a big effect and potential outcome. This is especially true for individuals who have slight excess visceral fat.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Why do I look worse now, are my AirSculpt results normal?

59954,question,,"I see many small breasted women looking for a natural looking result from breast augmentation. Manyplastic surgeons havebefore and after breast augmentation gallery exclusively of women with limited breast tissue, like athletes and fitness models,that includes many petite women with natural looking results from breast augmentation. Obviously, a given implant volume and diameter that works well for a small-framed patient that is 5'3 will be inadequate for a large-framed patient that is 5'10. Careful evaluation of all of these issues is necessary if the ultimate goal of the surgery is a natural-appearing breast augmentation. Having practiced plastic surgery in the 'breast augmentation capital of the world' (Los Angeles), I have developed some fairly strong opinions about this operation. In thinking about breast augmentation surgery, I believe that the most important question for a prospective patient to ask themselves is this: Am I seeking a natural-appearing result? When the goal of this operation is a natural breast enhancement, the results can be absolutely beautiful. However, if the goal is to create a breast profile which is out of proportion to a woman's body, the results (by definition) never appear natural, and these patients not infrequently end up having a series of operations to address problems with their abnormal appearance. For that reason, I encourage women who are investigating breast augmentation to consider a breast implant size that will help them 'fill out clothes better' and improve the overall proportions of their body, not one that makes them look like the gal with the boob job. Quite a number of my breast augmentation patients are moms. After one or more pregnancies, most women experience a loss of breast volume combined with some 'stretching out' of the breast skin. In many of these patients, a breast implant of moderate size will restore a very pleasing breast contour. These patients are NOT looking to raise eyebrows at work or around the neighborhood - they just want to throw their padded bras away, and to feel better about their appearance in private. In profile, the natural-appearing breast is not convex in the upper pole, and an excessively convex and overly full upper pole is a dead giveaway that a breast implant sits below the skin. Likewise, if the inframammary fold is lowered too far, the augmented breast will appear 'bottomed out', with an excessively full lower pole, an empty upper pole, and a nipple/areola that appears to sit too high on the breast - another situation with a distinctly unnatural appearance. The horizontal position of breast implants also requires a great deal of attention, both in pre-operative planning and in the operating room. Excessive lateral dissection of the implant pockets will result in augmented breasts with an excessively wide space between them in the cleavage area, and the appearance that the breasts are abnormally far apart. Inadequate lateral dissection, on the other hand, will result in an augmentation with an abnormal 'side by side' appearance. As it is lateral projection of the breasts beyond the lateral limit of the chest wall (in frontal view) that, along with the concavity of the waist profile and the convexity of the hip profile, produces the appearance of an 'hourglass figure', careful attention must be paid to ensure that lateral breast projection is not inadequate. Another consideration is that the breast implant base diameter must match the existing anatomic limits of the breast preoperatively and the breadth of the anterior chest in general.

Ive heard of plastic surgeons who have a two-year waiting period for surgery.That said surgical scheduling is a bit of a dynamic and fluid process that tends to change regularly.People change their minds, things happen and patience sometimes need to change their schedule and openings become available.There are plenty of plastic surgeons who have open practices with availability for surgery any day of the week as well.Generally highly sought-after providers tend to have a reputation that drives a loyal following. Sometimes the reputation is directly related to talent and sometimes its not.For example plastic surgeons who do regular television appearances tend to be very good at South promotion but this has no correlation with surgical skills.There are extremely talented surgeons who do not spend any effort whatsoever promoting themselves and are relatively unheard of by the public at large.The busiest time for cosmetic surgery tends to be spring time and theres always a small uptick around the holidays for individuals wanting to take advantage of time off for recovery. right after the holidays and in the fall Kansas to be a little slower but this also depends a lot on certain procedures.Liposuction and breast implants tend to be spring oriented procedures but these are generalizations.Scheduling may be important but it is not nearly as important as choosing the right provider in regards to skill and experience.I recommend all patients have multiple in person consultations to help find the most skilled and experienced provider.During each consultation ask each provider to open up their portfolio and show their entire collection of before and after pictures.Being shown a handful of preselected pictures which most likely represent the best results of the providers career is insufficient to get a clear understanding of what the average results look like in the hands of each provider. for this reason patients should ask the provider to show as many pictures as they are willing to specifically asking to see examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and less than outcomes.I highly recommend prospective patients bring pictures of their own torso and undergarments similar to how plastic surgeons take before and after pictures to use as a reference. You should then ask the provider to show as many pictures as possible of patients who have similar body characteristics to your own.An experience provider should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets Ill before and after pictures. Highly experienced surgeons will have hundreds or even thousands of before and after pictures of commonly performed procedures.Its definitely a good idea to ask providers about revision rates even asking to see examples of patients who ended up needing revisions and what they look like. You should have a clear understanding of what their policy is regarding revisions if youre unhappy with the outcome.When judging providers in the vetting process of finding the best provider I recommend patients first get accustomed to what typical tummy tuck results should look like.Quality work is usually represented first and foremost by a natural appearing bellybutton and central abdomen. This together with a very low set scar that follows anatomic contours naturally and evenly on both sides are hallmarks of quality work. A talented plastic surgeon will create a balanced and harmonious looking torso from all angles by adjusting the procedure as needed so the entire torso looks good from all angles. for some individuals this may include an extended tummy tuck removing skin laxity all the way to the back or adding Liposuction to contour hips and waist or reduce love handles.Do not judge surgeons based on what the scar itself looks like since that is more a reflection of how individual people heal and the timeframe in regards to when the surgery was performed. Skin incisions take 12 to 18 months before they are mature and can look unsightly during the first year especially the first three months.This is often about the same time that patients come in for their follow up appointments and its relatively rare for patients to follow up for surgery 18 months after the procedure. For this reason it is not all that common for surgeons to capture after pictures with scars that are in their mature state.Preferably the scar or incision should be designed to be slightly convex around the mons pubis then follow in the groin crease out to the hips.A full tummy tuck is that invasive procedure that patients need to be both physically and emotionally prepared for it. The experience can be overwhelming for some and often create an emotional roller coaster.Results are permanent any reversible. When done poorly its often difficult to improve on the outcome.Patience who are willing to put in the time and effort to properly vent to plastic surgeons to seek out the most talented and experience provider I have the best chances of quality outcomes with a consistent high level of patient satisfaction.Certain individuals will inherently be better candidates for quality outcomes than others and a talented experienced surgeon will make it clear exactly what kind of results you should expect, what can be accomplished and what cannot be accomplished with each procedure and alternatives.I recommend patients do not schedule surgery on the date of consultation but rather give themselves time to think about decisions that will change your body permanently. Finish all consultations scheduled before committing to a surgical procedure. When in doubt slow down and schedule more consultations.The expression do it once do it right comes to mind repeatedly.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: How far ahead to schedule a tummy tuck?",/question/ardmore-pennsylvania-schedule

4541817,question,,"Hi,It sounds like a few things may need to happen... Typically the answer would be no.&nbsp;After the majority of your weight loss, tummy tuck abdominoplasty and panniculectomy can tighten loose sagging tissues. This surgery is designed toremove and re-drape redundant lower and middle abdominal wall skin and fat. An incision above the pubic region and extending towards the hips places the scar where it can be hidden by most clothing. The skin and fat are separated from the underlying fascia (layer covering the muscles of the abdominal wall). In the standard operation this dissection continues up to the ribs exposing the vertical muscles (rectus muscles). The skin around the belly button (navel or umbilicus) is divided so the redundant tissue of the upper abdomen can be pulled down. This hole will frequently be pulled far enough down to be removed with the excess tissue. When less tissue needs to be removed, this hole may become a short vertical component of the lower scar. The abdominal wall muscles are then drawn together in the midline narrowing the waistline. This stitching firms the abdominal wall and removes some bulging. If you are also having a hernia repair it will be dealt with at this time.The repair of a hernia depends on the size of the hernia. The standard method of hernia repair involves making an incision in the abdominal wall. Hernia repair done concurently with a panniculectomy may include a midline incision as well as a bikini line suprapubic incision. Conversely, there may be no additional incision, other than the suprapubic incision, when the hernia repair is done concurently with the panniculectomy. This area, the hernia, is then repaired with sutures. Often a prosthetic material such as mesh, another plastic or biological material is sutured in place to strengthen the area and close the defect.The skin flap is then stretched down, the extra skin, underlying fat and tissue is removed. A new hole is cut for the navel, if you choose to transplant your navel, and contoured to create its shape. There are other options that can be discussed with your surgeon for the look of a navel without the possible complications of the transplanted navel not taking in its new location.There may also be some degree of Mons Pubis (the mound of fatty tissue just covering the pubic bone just above the pubic area) lift after panniculectomy.Good Luck&nbsp;","Richard K.

4996377,question,,"To answer this question, lets talk aboutthe timing of the procedureandhow pregnancy plays a role in all this.So, how do you time yourprocedure?First, you need to be able to afford it. You need to have the savings, tax refund, available credit, or financing. That's clear cut.Then, you need to be able to take the one week off (whether thats work, school, or being a mom). That week is for recovery. So you have to arrange that.Now comes the question that confuses many women who are considering breast augmentation: do you do it now or wait until after pregnancy/another child?Pregnancy will not ruin your breast implants.Whether you have implants or not, pregnancy and breastfeeding will do things to your body. When youre pregnant, your body releases more hormones. Youll gain weight. Your skin will be stretched by the pregnancy weight and lose some elasticity. And after childbirth and breastfeeding, your breast will deflate and your skin will be looser.Now, there are two major unpredictable factors surrounding these changes I just mentioned. First, the degree that these changes will occur is unpredictable. We don't know and can't know ahead of time, how much your breasts will deflate or how much looser your skin will become.And second, it is unpredictable whether these changes will warrant a procedure. Maybe the deflation will be mild and not warrant a breast lift.So given these two unknowns, it is impossible to predict whether you will need a lift after pregnancy and breastfeeding. But note that If you already have a breast augmentation, the implants will not affect those factors.The bottom line is that there is too much uncertainty to make a decision based on these possibilities. Thats why I take the following approach:When patients ask me whether they should get an augmentation now or wait, I ask them, Are you presently, proactively having sex with your partner with the purpose of getting pregnant? It's the most direct way of describing family planning.If the answer is yes, they should wait. It's a no-brainer. You should not have this surgery while pregnant, and since you're trying to get pregnant, there is a good chance it will happen soon.If the answer is no, im not trying to get pregnant, then I give the green light for the breast augmentation. When someone vaguely anticipates having a child within the next couple of years, there is too much uncertainty there. It could happen 1 year, 2 years or 5 years from now. And again, we don't know how much your body will change as a result of the pregnancy.So, to sum up:Can you afford to pay for the procedure? Yes.Can you schedule one week off from your vocation for recovery? Yes.Are you proactively trying to get pregnant? No. If this is the case, then the best time is now. Think about it: why do you want a breast augmentation in the first place? It's because you want to feel more confident and beautiful.And when is the best time to feel more confident and beautiful? Is the best time now, or in a couple years? Of course, the answer is Now.Recently, I had a 33-year-old patient who was a mom. I did a breast augmentation (saline, moderate profile). She went from a B to a full C cup. Looking at her post-op results, she was thrilled. And she said to me, I wish I had met you 10 years ago!I get that so often. And I'm sure other surgeons do too. The reason for this wish is simple: patients love the way they look and feel after breast augmentation, and wish that they had experienced this boost in self-esteem sooner in their lives.So technically, based on patient feedback, the best time to feel confident and beautiful is years ago. But, since we can't travel back in time, if you can afford to and are not family planning, the second best choice is now. And if you are actively trying to get pregnant with your partner, of course, you should wait until after pregnancy.I hope that answers your question on breast implants and pregnancy. Its great that youre doing this research. I always say that the best patients are informed patients.","William Rahal, MD answers: Wait Until After Children for Breast Augmentation?",/question/breast-augmentation-0

9566601,question,,"Hi Josephine,&nbsp;YES! Carboxy therapy works&nbsp;well for dark circles and puffy under eye area if the problem is caused by poor circulation as that is how it works for those problems.&nbsp;Poor circulation under the eyes can be from: genetics ( you are born with it, mom or dad has it), allergies, filler in the under eye area, surgery.&nbsp;When circulation is poor the good stuff (oxygen, nutrients, enzymes for cell function) cannot get into the area well (think traffic is backed up and your car can't get where it is going). Additionally, the garbage that your cells generate gets stuck (think traffic again...your car can't get out of where it is). This combination means less healthy new cells and more damaged dying cells.....and thats why the eyes look like they do.&nbsp;Allergies cause inflammation, inflammation is swelling and impedes or overwhelms the flow of the circulation. Filler is a mechanical blocker of circulation. Genetics....you don't have great circulation in the first place.&nbsp;Injecting CO2 into the very superficial tissue around the eyes basically opens up the highways so that traffic flows. Good stuff can come in and bad stuff can flow out. It works&nbsp; great, but it takes some time. Typically when clients have the puffiness, they see results fairly quickly sometimes even after the first treatment although generally it doesn't last long term yet because nothing has permanently changed in the quality of the circulation yet. So it just gets the flow going but it can't change the capacity of flow right away. Think of a highway that is always full of traffic, and really needs a new lane added to handle the capacity of all the cars that need to flow in and out of the area.&nbsp;The carboxy therapy, when done repeatedly on a weekly basis, will eventually convince the brain that it needs to start generating new healthy circulation (more lanes on the highway). That is when you should see the improvements last. Now if you have allergies, that needs to be addressed as an underlying problem that is blocking flow in order to get long term improvements that hold. Depending on the underlying issues some clients need to come in on a monthly basis, and some can hold out for years. Someone experienced in years of CO2 therapy can guide you on this depending on your particular situation.&nbsp;Treatments in my clinic are $249 a session, and we do 1x per week for about 2 months. If you are not seeing any changes (even temporary) for 4 sessions, something is not working. Either the treatment is not being done correctly or you have an underlying issue that needs addressing usually allergies. A good practitioner should rarely cause any bruising and be able to minimize it if it does happen immediately during the treatment.&nbsp;I have never seen anything else work as well for the under eyes except blepheroplasty when there is an excessive amount of loose or fat pockets, and never for dark circles. Filler is a hit or miss under the eyes and can cause more problems than it can fix.&nbsp;I hope this helpsAll the best,&nbsp;Dr Jam","Jame Heskett, MD answers: Is carboxitherapy effective for under eye bags?

	If you drive a sports car 100mph at a concrete wall and are told if you stand on the brakes at 150 feet from the wall you will stop in time and survive, would you ask if it OK to start braking at 110 feet? Someone might be concerned that you might not be able to exert full force on the brakes and advise 170 feet. Is that incorrect, or &quot;less&quot; correct than 150 feet? Why not try the brakes at 50 feet? At some point you will hit the wall and die; at another you will just miss hitting the concrete barrier. Whose advice will you feel safest with?

	Your doctor has asked you to abstain from smoking 4 weeks before surgery. If you disregard this advice, will you also take off your nose splint prematurely (to&quot;see how it looks&quot;)? Or blow your nose before being advised it is OK? Or exercise when told not to?

	Kind patient, I would not want you for my patient since you want to write your own rules, but yet will undoubtedly ask your surgeon to be responsible for and &quot;fix&quot; any disaster that is really your fault. Do you really think depressed and bored is better with dead nose skin?

	You already know the answer here--FOLLOW YOUR SURGEON&#39;S ADVICE. You can ask your own doctor for medication to help you with this. It IS important. Good luck!

59962,question,,"In my Raleigh, North Carolina Plastic Surgery Practice the majority of the patients I see for tummy tucks are moms. Many women, after one or more pregnancies, will have changes in both the abdominal soft tissues (skin and fat) and the abdominal wall. This usually consists of loose, flaccid skin with (but sometimes without) stretchmarks, and outward bulging of the abdominal wall, especially below the belly button. These changes occur in response to both mechanical expansion of the abdomen by the growing baby and to pregnancy hormones that circulate in high levels only during gestation.	For most patients with these post-pregnancy changes, no amount of diet or exercise will significantly improve the abdominal appearance. Most of these patients require a full tummy tuck, as described above. A full tummy tuck involves removal of most or all of the skin and fat between the pubic area and the existing belly button, tightening of the rectus abdominis ('6-pack') muscles from the bottom of the sternum to the pubic bone, and creation of a new belly button. Some abdominal and hip liposuction is usually performed as well.	A few patients have severe post-pregnancy skin and soft tissue excess that cannot be adequately corrected by means of a horizontal, suprapubic incision alone. In select patients, a vertical midline incision can be added to allow removal of skin excess in a horizontal as well as vertical direction. A great advantage of adding this incision is the ability to draw the waist inward as the tummy tuck is closed. This procedure is sometimes referred to as an 'anchor' or 'inverted-T abdominoplasty', as the resulting scar has that configuration. The technique is performed for patients in whom the resulting improvement in the overall abdominal profile outweighs the 'downside' of a midline surgical scar.	The nature of the tummy tuck surgery that will best suit each patient is determined during the consultation and is based on the physical examination. For all patients, I draw the proposed incisions on their body with a skin marker (it washes off easily) so that it is clear what the nature of the resulting surgical scars will be. I also outline liposuction areas if that is part of the surgical plan.

222909,question,,"
	The question posed by a size 2,&nbsp; fit mother of 2 is whether a tummy tuck can be done leaving scars on the sides.

	The answer to this question depends on the particulars of the situation.&nbsp; In this case, the author indicates the muscles aren&#39;t stretched.&nbsp; This seldom turns out to be the case at the time of surgery after two pregnancies.&nbsp; Even the most fit mothers often benefit from muscle tightening.

	Other issues to be considered are how much loose skin is there and is it loose&nbsp; vertically, horizontally or both?&nbsp; Veritcal skin excess is best dealt with through horizontal incisions like the traditional bikini line incision.&nbsp; This is the most common situation.&nbsp; If the vertical excess were confined only to the hips one could, in theory use horizontal incisions on the sides.&nbsp; I have never found thid to be the case.&nbsp; The uterus is located in the center of the pelvis and as the pregnancy progresses the fetal growth is roughly midline which accounts for the spreading of the midline abdominal muscles and the central skin excess.&nbsp; Circumferential skin excess is most commonly seen in the population&nbsp; having experienced massive weight loss, such as after gastric bypass.&nbsp; These patients usually have both circulferential and vertical skin excess.&nbsp; Most contouring procedures will still begin with a horizontal skin removal at the belt line but may go completely around the waist in an attempt to redistribute the circumferential skin excess.&nbsp; If this proves inadequate then right and left vertical skin removal on the dsides may be the only alternative.&nbsp; This leaves a scar the entire lenght of the torso on each side.&nbsp; Such a scar is often satisfactory to a person who formerly weighed 400 pounds but is usually not acceptable to a fit mom who has never been obese.

1855568,question,,"Recovery time after any surgery will vary from patient to patientbased on a number of different factors.  Since a mom he make over refers to a number ofdifferent operations it will just depend on which ones are done.  Remembera mommy make over typically refers to an operation that improves the look and shapeof a woman's breasts. At the same time it also deals with contouring of theabdominal wall.  The breast operations that could be done include; abreast augmentation, a breast lift, breast reduction, or breast lift with theaddition of breast implants.  As far as the abdomen goes the operationscould include; liposuction only, a mini tummy tuck, full tummy tuck, tummy tuckwith liposuction or a lipo-abdominoplasty.  Typically the breast surgeriesdon't have much more than 7-10 days of general recovery, with restrictions onhigh impact activities up to 6 weeks.  For most of my patients they findthat the breast operations are comfortable enough were more than a day or 2 ofpain medicines is not necessary.  The abdominal procedures on the otherhand are where most of the recovery comes from.  For my tummy tuckpatient's, including those that have a Mommy make over, I typically tell themthat they will need between 2 and 3 weeks of general recovery.  Again noheavy lifting or high impact activity for 6 weeks is typically recommended. Ifwe think in terms of recovery there are multiple different aspects of it.  When some people talked about recovery there is simply referring to howthey will feel.  Pain, discomfort, tightness, are all aspects of this formof the recovery, So for each one of these it'll vary from patient to patient. Another aspect of recovery is returned to physical activity.  Inthis aspect of recovery it is more depend on a physiologic response which doesnot vary as much from patient to patient.   In a normal patient who is notdiabetic, protein malnourished, a smoker, or on steroids,  they can expect50% of the strength of a healing wound to be there by 6 weeks.  Thereforea lot of the restrictions that I recommend to patient's postoperatively areremoved by 6 weeks.  In the final kind of healing I talked by patient'sabout it when they will feel normal.  For most patients this could take upto 12 weeks.  With the exception of numbness that can happen in theoperative fields were this kind of recovery could really take between 15 and 18months.

76396,question,,"Dear BrdlvrRemember that that are several time frames for healing after eyelid surgery.  The one we are talking about is when will you be ready for social activities.  This means at what point can you go about socially without most people noticing that there is something about your eyes.  Generally bruising following eyelid surgery resolved at the one-week time frame but the eyelids are generally quite swollen.  After a few more days this begins to settle down.  Steroids can speed up this process but there are also significant downside risks with steroids including but not limited to mood disorders.  So except for usual professional circumstances (actors, judges, etc) we avoid steroids. However, this does not mean that you are fully healed from your eyelid surgery.  I generally allow my patients to go for a walk (under 3 mph and less than an hour) on the day after surgery but no vigorous activity (including vigorous sexual activity) for 3 weeks.  It is generally about 6 to 8 weeks for much of the eyelid swelling to resolve but this type of swelling will only be visible to you and your doctor.Regarding the claim that you should only go to a board certified plastic surgeon, beware that there are actually several specialties that offer cosmetic eyelid surgery: General plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons, oculoplastic surgeons, and some cosmetic dermatologic surgeons.  There are no studies establishing that one of these specialties does better surgery than another.  Also credentials alone do not make for a good surgeon.  I think that it is helpful if your surgeon is board certified in ophthalmology, general plastic surgery, or otolaryngology and fellowship trained in oculoplastic surgery, facial plastic surgery, or cosmetic surgery.  However, these qualifications do not guarantee the quality of the work.  Contact the medical board that licenses the surgeon to learn if there are any disciplinary actions against this doctor.  Any doctor that has been in practice long enough may have been sued for medical malpractice.  In particular, you should be concerned if the surgeon has been sued successfully multiple times.  Also, is there a history of a criminal conviction?  Often these individuals regain their medical license but what does a history of a criminal conviction say about the basic honesty and integrity of you doctor?  Is your doctor proposing to do your cosmetic surgery as a medically necessary surgery?  This may help you financially but what does this criminal behavior say about your doctor?  And no-not everyone does this.  Does your doctor have hospital privileges at a reputable hospital near their office?  Has the doctor ever lost hospital privileges because of disciplinary action?  Upstanding surgeons have no trouble answering these types of questions and they also wash their hands before touching you.Next, consider the before and after photos of your surgeon.  If you don't like what you see, remember this is what the doctor feels is their very best work.  If you don't like what you see, don't assume your results will be any better.  Ask yourself how you were treated at your consultation.  Was the staff courteous and informative, or did you feel like you were a burden.  Who did you see during your consultation?  Was it just the surgical counselor or did you actually get to see the surgeon?  Your surgeon should not be so busy that they have not time to personally meet with you.  There are offices that operate this way and it is not appropriate.  Did you get all of your questions answered?  Did your surgeon make sense?  Did your potential surgeon make you feel comfortable?I am a board certified ophthalmologist and have completed multiple fellowships in both eye plastic surgery and cosmetic surgery.  My bias is that the board certification in ophthalmology and fellowship training in eye plastic surgery are invaluable for performing eyelid cosmetic surgery at the highest level.  I also think that it is helpful to look for a surgeon with a university appointment who also is involved in teaching other surgeons, contributes to the scientific literature, and develops new procedures.

1735890,question,,"Hi. It's always best to have patients near their ideal weight. However, based on your photos, I feel you arena excellent candidate for a BBL.The key is............ does the surgeon have a keen sense of aesthetics? Can he/she create a shapely, attractive buttock or are they just technicians that wind up with large unshapely behinds? The same holds true for the liposuction portion of the procedure. Understand that liposuction whether SAL, PAL or UAL ( not including LAL because the fat obtained through this technique will not be useful) is not that technically challenging. However, the keen aesthetic eye will determine the eventual work of art.We are creators and have the ability to turn out beautiful works of art. Simply put................not all artists create quality work.I would encourage you to research , research and research some more. Real Self is a great web site for education. Avail yourself of it's contents. When selecting your surgeon never let costs or geography prevent you from seeking the best. I have been performing liposuction in Miami for the past 29 years. Miami has become the land of BBLs........some very good and some that look awful. I encourage you do research, research and then research some more. Our city is filled with mom and pop shops for cosmetic surgery. Buyer beware. You need to know that liposuction or for that matter re injecting fat is not the most technically challenging procedure for a surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. Search for a surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgey with years of experience in liposuction and fat transfers. Look at unbiased reviews. Look at many before and after photos of the surgeon who will be doing your procedure. In South Florida, many clinics provide photos that do not necessarily represent the work to be performed by that particular surgeon. How about the center, clinic or facility? Are they accredited by a national organization or do they just have State approval. Understand that at the current time, there are three nationally recognized organizations responsible for the highest levels of patient safety, AAAASF, AAACH and JCHO. You owe it to yourself to position yourself for the best possible results but under the most stringent safety regulations.How about anesthesia? Will you have a medical doctor certified by the American Board of Anesthesiology or a certified nurse anesthetist (CRNA)? Understand that there is no substitute for research. Cosmetic surgery, no matter how simple it may be to the patients, are invasive procedures and as such carry certain risks and complications.In our office we use TouchMD which is a web based program in which patients have the ability to load their picture unto the program. We can accommodate patients from as far away as California. I then evaluate them and can actually draw on the picture to show a potential patient where the incisions would be located and how the procedure is to be realized. It's all done to comply with HIPPA which is the federal law that protects the patient's medical information. Look them up.Give yourself the highest percentage of a sucssesful operation.

6265251,question,,"Thanks for your question -- I get this every time I perform a Tummy Tuck on Snapchat -- I heard that it's not safe to do lipo with TT. Not true. For experienced surgeons with proper technique, combining liposuction with Tummy Tuck is a powerful contouring tool that safely allows us to achieve far better results in patients that are healthy and non-obese.My belief is that a Tummy Tuck is not a Tummy Tuck is not a Tummy Tuck. In my practice I routinely perform 360 degree liposuction of the trunk with a Tummy Tuck procedure and often use the fat from lipo (I call it liquid gold) for for transferring to the buttock area. This helps achieve a sexy, youthful figure much more than can be achieved with Tummy Tuck alone -- and who doesnt want a sexier, more youthful figure? I also further thin the abdominal-tummy area with Tummy Tuck by sharply cutting out the deep fat layer.Followers of my Snapchat (at DenverBodyDoc) are very familiar with Lipo 360 and BBL, with or without Tummy TuckandI regularly perform this in patients from a BMI in the low 20s up to a BMI of 30:Lipo 360 is the concept of performing lipo of the entire trunk from the area that bulges at your armpit above the bra, to the bra-roll and back to significantly shaping in the waistline and abdominal-tummy area and the mons pubis or FUPA area-- in short I work to achieve a lean-appearance with thin, even layers all around. Some patients will benefit from lipo of a smaller area, but these are very lean patients that already have thin layers elsewhere.BBL or Brazilian Butt Lift uses fat from liposuction to shape the buttock area. I use it as an addition tool to extend my ability to provide contour more than can be achieve with the subtractionof liposuction alone. Many patients will benefit from even a small amount of fat transfer for providing a more youthful filling of the buttock area, where others desire more increase in size and shape.To achieve dramatic results with combined procedures, it is important that your surgeon have extensive experience with the preparation, execution and post-op care in their practice. With this appropriate care and technique, the safety of these procedures has long been well established and is widely published in the plastic surgery literature.Please take a look at photos of my patients at the weblink below.

A reduction without implants will not give quality breast projection but will get your nipple position where they should be and reduce your overall size to something more appropriate.Further weight loss will make you an even better candidate for the procedure.Schedule in person consultation with multiple local a board-certified plastic surgeon.Plastic surgeons pushing you towards the breast surgery not being covered by insurance are requiring you to pay private cosmetic fees are not serving your best interest though each plastic surgeon has a right to device policy on what they accept and what they dont.During each consultation look for the most talented provider based on who gets quality results which should be judged by who can get consistent natural looking belly buttons with a very low set scar that follows the anatomic contours naturally, is even on both sides and leaves the abdomen looking balanced attractive and proportions from all angles including from behind. in your case a slightly extended tummy tuck or well-done Liposuction of your love handles may be required to get an ideal female figure and to get the rest of your torso to balance the improvement on the front from the tummy tuck.Get Haily familiarized with with a quality tummy tuck results look like and create a grading system you can use while vetting each plastic surgeons on the above points.

Plastic surgeons may be apprehensive to do that and may wish to stick to showing you their preselected pictures which most likely represent the best results of their career.Preselected pictures are however not an appropriate representation of what average results will look like.An experience provider should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures of commonly performed procedures like a full tummy tuck or breast lift/reduction. Bring pictures of your own torso taking similarly to help plastic surgeons take before and after pictures and use that for a reference when asking providers to show as many pictures as possible of patients who have similar body characteristics to your own.Based on a practiced rating system review each plastic surgeons results based on the number of pictures and how they score on each of the above characteristics of quality work.Continue having consultations until you found a sufficiently skilled and talented surgeon for your needs whos willing to work with you especially regarding insurance coverage at a facility where you can use your insurance to spend the night after the surgery.The ability to spend the night in a hospital or proper surgical facility after a full tummy tuck and holds great value.

Youve done poorly the first time its very difficult to make any significant improvements with revision work.To find the best provider I recommend patients first and foremost get familiarized with what quality results look like.This begins by having pictures of your own Taurus I will take him the same way plastic surgeons take before and after pictures of spaceThis begins by having pictures of your own Taurus I will take him the same way plastic surgeons take before and after pictures. Typically pictures of your torso from your neck to your knees taken from about 8 feet away standing in a neutral position showing your front, side and backside. avoid taking pictures and reflections in mirrors and instead to use the timer on your camera or have someone else take the picture.Look at how plastic surgeons take before and after pictures and try to mimic those.Next review as many before and after pictures of previous patients who have similar body characteristics to your own as much as possible.I suggest you create a rating or a grading system regarding quality outcomes from previous patients who have similar body characteristics to your own.When you have consultations with plastic surgeons and they show you before and after pictures do you need to know immediately if those results are good quality or not.Look for quality work based on who gets the most natural looking belly button or generally how the mid abdomen looks and specifically the belly button. do they look natural?That is probably the biggest tip off that youre in the hands of a good or not so good plastic surgeon.Creating a good looking mirror of demented with a natural belly button consistently in tummy tuck surgery is one of the hardest parts of the procedure and surgeons who do that well tend to know what theyre doing.The second valuable at least in my opinion is a very low Seth scar that follows anatomic contours naturally and evenly on both sides leaving the torso looking attractive, balanced inappropriate from all angles including from behind. ideally the incision should be convex over the mons pubis and then follow right in the groin crease as it progresses out to each hip.I suggest patients schedule multiple in person consultations avoiding virtual consultations whenever possible. I also recommend people avoid traveling long distances for elective procedures especially a procedure like a full tummy tuck.During each in person consultation ask each provider to open up their portfolio and show you their entire collection before and after picture for the procedure they recommend.Ask providers to only show you pictures of previous patients who have similar body characteristics to your own. Theres no point in seeing results of patients who had a completely different body characteristics to you.Ask your provider to show you examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and results that didnt turn out as well as they had hoped for.We all have a variety of outcomes and its fair game for patients to ask to see these pictures.Being shown a handful of preselected images which must likely represent the best results of the providers career is totally insufficient to get a clear understanding of what average results look like or how many of these procedures anyone the surgeon has actually performed.For reference an experienced surgeon that should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures. Based on you previously reviewing before and after pictures of previous patients with some other body characteristics to your own you should then be able to give the scores to the results you are surgeon is now showing you as well as taking good notes about your overall thoroughness of the consultation including examination, assessment, review of before and after pictures, preparation for surgery, recovery for surgery, review of medical history and reduction of medical complications especially pregnant to you.Theres no correct sets number of consultations people need to have but in order to find the best provider youre going to have to decipher the difference between a few of them.I suggest most patients start with a minimum of five in person consultations and unless its obvious one of those providers is clearly superior at this procedure consider having many more.Providers may be apprehensive to completely open up their portfolio and show you anything but their best results.That tells you a lot about that provider and then you can make an intelligent decision if you want to consider keeping that provider on your list or if you should simply move onto the next one. you may want to consider telling providers that the decision of who does the operation its a large part going to be based on who is willing to show the greatest number of pictures including variety of outcome.You were the one hiring the surgeon and you have a full rate to properly but that provider and that includes asking for supporting information like sufficient numbers and before and after pictures to get a really clear idea of what their work typically looks like especially on people who have similar body characteristics to your own.When in doubt slow down and schedule more consultations.By having multiple consultations youll also have multiple opportunities to ask each surgeon how they feel and how they would manage your case based on your medical history.Theres a correct methodical approach for consulting for plastic surgery procedures.Generally the first step is to get an accurate assessment of your own body with a good understanding of treatment and the treatment alternatives. this includes having a clear understanding of what each procedure option can and cannot deliver.Youre done need to decipher which is the best provider in your community for the procedure youre interested in.If youre not careful in choosing the best provider you may be disappointed with the outcome and once performed it is very difficult to improve on the outcome of major body contouring procedures.What time to be a highly selective is before you have surgery.Be more selective than you think you need to be.Most people do not have a lot of experience consulting with plastic surgeons. On the other hand plastic surgeons have a lot of experience giving consultations.Make yourself a better consumer by practicing having lots of consultations so you get better at it.Do you need that skill to help you pick the right provider.Simply being a well intended what certified plastic surgeon with years of practice and years of training is insufficient to confirm that anyone is particularly good or has mastered anyone operation.Safety is important but theres no point in taking medical risk if the result doesnt make your body look substantially better.In regards to just aesthetics there are generally only two variables that really matter.They are the candidacy of the patient combined with the skill and experience of the surgeon.For most people there isnt much they can do regarding their candidacy. There are exceptions like obese people who should probably lose weight before considering having surgery. What people do have control over is the choice of provider.Please take advantage of that incredible opportunity to choose the best provider in your community and do that by having multiple in person consultations will you take an active role in vetting the provider.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Managing risk of complications in patients over 50 during an abdominoplaty - how should I prepare?",/question/haleyville-al-tummy-tuck-managing-risk-complications-endometriosis-hystorectomy

12354179,question,,"Plastic surgeons will have different opinions when it comes to patients who are on the verge of candidacy.First and foremost I would recommend relying exclusively on in person consultations so that surgeons have the opportunity to examine you and talk about treatment options face-to-face.Anyone can have a tummy tuck but the ability to clear the belly button with a low said scar is what is of concern.For individuals who dont have sufficient skin to remove all the skin from above the belly button too low in the pubic area and opening around the belly button leaving a small vertical scar just above the main incision may be necessary.This extra small incision is well worth it to place the incision in a very low location.Setting the scar as low as possible gives to patient debility to hide a scar with undergarments, swimsuits and creates the appearance on an elongated torso.With the acceptance of a secondary small vertical scar anyone can have a full tummy tuck with a very low set scar.Its far easier to explain the concepts, treatment options and show examples with before and after pictures when meeting in person.Plastic surgeons will also differ on their view of liposuction prior to a tummy tuck.Personally I have found that liposuction prior to a tummy tuck creates a fine network of scar tissue that reduces the skin and fat layer pliability or stretchiness.This reduces further how much skin can be removed and works as a hindrance for someone like you who may not have enough skin to clear the belly button.A tummy tuck by itself will fill out the fat layer when pulling the skin tight just like a rubber band becomes thin when pulling a tight.This ability to pull the skin tight with a reciprocal thinning of the fat layer is reduced with less elasticity due to scar tissue from previous liposuction.In the end the most important variable is finding the right provider. Doing that is better done within person consultations than any other method.During each in person consultation ask each provider to open up their portfolio and show you their entire collection of before and after pictures. Ask the providers to show as many pictures as possible of patients with similar body characteristics to your own.Being shown a handful of preselected pictures which most likely represent the best results of the providers career is insufficient to get an accurate Idea of what the average results look like in the hands of each provider. Ask each provider to shows many pictures as possible of patients with similar body characteristics to your own.A consultation should also include a history of each individual persons scar history which can be assessed by looking at any previous area were you may have had surgery or injuries resulting in any type of scar formation.Knowing in advance what your scar will look like can I have a big impact on the decision of what is the right procedure.Individuals who are prone to hypertrophic and hyper pigmented scars may do well avoiding operations with large scars especially around the belly button.The hallmark of a quality tummy tuck is a natural looking belly button with a very low set scar that follows anatomic contours naturally and evenly on both sides. The scar should be set in the groin crease.The incision should have a slight convex curvature over the mons pubis.Make careful notes of what surgeons get the most natural best looking belly buttons based on the viewing as many before and after pictures as possible.Finally a good plastic surgeon will adjust the procedure by either extending the tummy tuck or doing adjuvant liposuction to make sure the torso looks good from all angles when indicated.An experienced provider should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets before and after pictures. Highly experienced surgeons will have hundreds or even thousands.Ask providers to show you examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and less than outcomes. We all have them and its fair game for patients to ask to see a variety of different results.You should also ask the surgeon what theyre revision rate this and ask if they would be willing to show you examples of patients who had revisions and what that looks like. plastic surgeons should have a certain revision rates.Continue having consultations until you feel quite confident you found the right provider for your needs.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Is this enough skin for a full/extended tummy tuck?

56533,question,,"Having practiced plastic surgery in the 'breast augmentation capital of the world' (Los Angeles), I have developed some fairly strong opinions about this operation. In thinking about breast augmentation surgery, I believe that the most important question for a prospective patient to ask themselves is this: Am I seeking a natural-appearing result? When the goal of this operation is a natural breast enhancement, the results can be absolutely beautiful.However, if the goal is to create a breast profile which is out of proportion to a woman's body, the results (by definition) never appear natural, and these patients not infrequently end up having a series of operations to address problems with their abnormal appearance. For that reason, I encourage women who are investigating breast augmentation to consider a breast implant size that will help them 'fill out clothes better' and improve the overall proportions of their body, not one that makes them look like the gal with the boob job.Quite a number of my breast augmentation patients are moms. After one or more pregnancies, most women experience a loss of breast volume combined with some 'stretching out' of the breast skin. In many of these patients, a breast implant of moderate size will restore a very pleasing breast contour. These patients are NOT looking to raise eyebrows at work or around the neighborhood - they just want to throw their padded bras away, and to feel better about their appearance in private.When there is laxity of the breast skin that makes the breasts appear somewhat droopy, the addition of a breast implant of moderate size can 'fill up' the excess skin and create the appearance of a breast lift (although this is not truly a breast lift or 'mastopexy'). This is often a situation that exists after pregnancy and lactation, but I also see quite a number of patients with significant breast skin laxity who have never been pregnant. In patients with more advanced drooping of the breasts, particularly when the nipples are pointing downwards instead of slightly upwards, a mastopexy (breast lift) needs to be combined with the breast augmentation surgery to tighten the skin envelope of the breasts, in order to produce a result that is truly youthful and aesthetically ideal. This procedure is called an augmentation mastopexy, and the results of this operation can be dramatic and absolutely transforming. It is discussed in greater detail as the next topic under the heading 'Body Contouring Surgery'.Attention to detailWhile the issue of 'over' or 'under' the pectoralis major muscle receives a great deal of attention, even more important than breast implant position relative to this muscle is implant position vertically and horizontally on the chest wall. In many patients, the inframammary fold needs to be lowered in order to allow the implant to rest at a level that appears natural relative to the position of the nipple and areola, and in order to prevent the appearance of excessive upper pole fullness. In profile, the natural-appearing breast is not convex in the upper pole, and an excessively convex and overly full upper pole is a dead giveaway that a breast implant sits below the skin. Likewise, if the inframammary fold is lowered too far, the augmented breast will appear 'bottomed out', with an excessively full lower pole, an empty upper pole, and a nipple/areola that appears to sit too high on the breast - another situation with a distinctly unnatural appearance.The horizontal position of breast implants also requires a great deal of attention, both in pre-operative planning and in the operating room. Excessive lateral dissection of the implant pockets will result in augmented breasts with an excessively wide space between them in the cleavage area, and the appearance that the breasts are abnormally far apart. Inadequate lateral dissection, on the other hand, will result in an augmentation with an abnormal 'side by side' appearance. As it is lateral projection of the breasts beyond the lateral limit of the chest wall (in frontal view) that, along with the concavity of the waist profile and the convexity of the hip profile, produces the appearance of an 'hourglass figure', careful attention must be paid to ensure that lateral breast projection is not inadequate.Another consideration is that the breast implant base diameter must match the existing anatomic limits of the breast preoperatively and the breadth of the anterior chest in general. Obviously, a given implant volume and diameter that works well for a small-framed patient that is 5'3 will be inadequate for a large-framed patient that is 5'10. Careful evaluation of all of these issues is necessary if the ultimate goal of the surgery is a natural-appearing breast augmentation.Choosing the breast implant sizeIn consultations I listen carefully to each patient to ensure that I clearly understand their goals for breast augmentation surgery. Based on that discussion, and on the physical examination, I go into surgery knowing what the ideal volume should be within two or three breast implant sizes. However, the patient and I do not decide on one particular size prior to surgery. There is absolutely no way, in my opinion, to know exactly what size implant is the ideal size for a particular patient in advance of creating the implant pockets in the operating room. For that reason I keep a wide range of implant sizes on hand in the surgery center.If natural is the goal, then the way to get the size right is to 'try out' different implant volumes in the operating room. Once the implant pockets have been created, I place a 'sizer' in one implant pocket and have the upper half of the O.R. table raised so that the patient is in an upright 'sitting' position (chest fully upright). The sizer is then inflated gradually to the point that the breasts appear full, but not unnaturally so. In this manner the exact volume that produces a full but natural breast profile is determined.For any patient there is obviously a range of implant volumes that would be considered natural. While one patient may seek an augmentation that is 'the small side of natural', another may be interested in something that is more on 'the large side of natural'. By using breast implant sizers to determine exactly what breast profile a given implant volume produces in the O.R., I am able to provide patients with the closest possible approximation of their preoperative goals.Saline breast implants of a moderate (and in my opinion, appropriate) volume look and feel natural. The implant sizes I most commonly use blend in nicely with existing breast tissue, and patient satisfaction is high. In the ten years I have been using saline implants I have yet to have a patient with saline breast implants return to say I'm not happy with these, take them out and put silicone gel implants in their place.","Michael Law, MD answers: Do saline breast implants look and feel natural?",/question/saline-breast-implants-look-feel-natural
12451349,question,,"Choosing the correct procedure should be based on a clear understanding of what the problem is.In other words the first step is to make an accurate diagnosis or assessment.For individuals who have skin laxity that goes beyond the front of the rub them in an extended tummy tuck is often indicated.To determine whether Liposuction and the love handles and waste is needed should be based on making an assessment and subcutaneous fat is contributing negatively and in a significant way to the contour in this area.You can differentiate skin versus skin laxity and pulling up on your skin until its nice and tight and having someone else take a picture or while looking in the mirror. you can do this and all parts of your body including your side and back.To measure the thickness of subcutaneous fat first put the skin under attention then gently pressed against your skin with the tip of one finger until you feel the underlying muscle wall.Based on your pictures you dont have a lot of subcutaneous fat but have substantial amounts of skin laxity.Based on pictures alone I think an extended or wraparound tummy tuck is all thats needed and I dont think Liposuction is going to add much because you dont have much fat to remove.Liposuction will not change the contour much if you still have skin laxity especially if there isnt much fat to remove.When consulting with plastic surgeons about an extended tummy tuck it is imperative that you have a clear understanding exactly how far the incisions will go and specifically if the surgeon is going to turn you during the operation.The limitations of a standard tummy tuck are the extent to which the surgeon can reach with a patient laying on their back.To remove more skin and the patient needs to either be turned on their side or face down.Turning people during surgery and under general anesthesia its a fairly complex process. When done for an extended tummy tuck the patient typically needs to be turned twice.Each time the patient has turned usually requires six people in the process can take half an hour.Operating and anesthesia time is expensive so you should recognize that the procedure will be more expensive and its more complex when an extended procedure is done.Its not just a little more of the same.Far too many patients and up not having extended tummy tucks that really should have had them.When insufficient skin removal is done patients are left with a tight flat front and a flabby waist line and back with large skin folds called dog ears. Dog ears are eliminated by scheduling an extended or wraparound tummy tuck a.k.a. body lift as the correct primary procedure.When in doubt its always better to take more skin rather than less and patient who had substantial weight loss.You appear to be an excellent candidate for an extended or wraparound tummy tuck and I do not think Liposuction will be necessary.If someone tries to sell you on additional liposuction then insist on seeing quality before and after pictures of patients with similar body characteristics to your own who had the procedure with and without Liposuction to see the difference.Because the tummy tuck itself will contour the backside so aggressively and accurately by doing an extended tummy tuck Liposuction is really not needed.Liposuction by itself cannot compensate for the amount of skin laxity you have.A Standard tummy tuck will most likely leaving you coming back for a revision removing the excess skin laxity on the backside as a second procedure.During consultations you need to make it very clear if the surgeon is going to turn you during surgery and exactly how far the incisions will go.Its not possible to do an extended tummy tuck without moving the patient during surgery.Insufficient skin excision on individuals who shouldve had an extended tummy tuck happens in 20% of cases.It is a common situation that is 100% preventable by scheduling the correct procedure in the first place.A tummy tuck is a permanent and in many ways irreversible operation.Theres a substantial difference in quality outcomes depending on who does the procedure.Become familiarized with what quality results look like.For quality work look specifically for the following variables.First and foremost a quality tummy tuck should always end up with a natural looking belly button.This is one of the hardest parts of the procedure and talented plastic surgeons consistently get the best looking belly buttons. The second variable is a very low sets car that follows an atomic contours naturally and evenly on both sides. The second variable is a very low sets car that follows an atomic contours naturally and evenly on both sides. plastic surgeons have a little impact on what the scar itself looks like which is almost exclusively related to how individual people healer as well as the timeframe when pictures were taken after the procedure.Skin incisions require 12 to 18 months before they stop changing.Abdominal scars often look unsightly at 3 to 6 months and this is often when after pictures are taken.What the surgeon does have control over is the design of the scar.Ideally the scars should be slightly convex over the mons pubis and then follow each slide in or very near the groin crease.Finally the torso should look attractive balanced and proportionate from all angles including from behind.Talented plastic surgeons will adjust the procedure based on each unique individuals needs and this includes adding either an extended Tell me tuck or adding liposuction when indicated.Become familiarized with quality results by reviewing lots of before and after pictures. Create a reading or a grading system for quality results giving points to things like natural looking belly button, Lois thats ska, ska that as well designed and the overall appearance of the torso.Before committing to surgery I recommend all patients schedule multiple in person consultations with local board-certified plastic surgeons in their community.During each consultation ask each provider to open up their portfolio and show you their entire collection of before and after pictures.Ask specifically to see as many pictures as possible of previous patients who had similar body characteristics to your own.Bring pictures of what your body looks like taken similar to how plastic surgeons take before and after pictures and use these for reference.You may want to print out pictures of your own torso to use when reviewing before and after pictures.Being shown a handful of preselected pictures which most likely represent the best results of a providers career is insufficient to get a clear understanding of what average results look like or how many of these procedures any one provider has done.For reference and experience surgeon should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sense of before and after pictures for commonly performed procedures like a tummy tuck.If providers are apprehensive to show you anything but their preselected show Intel photo album then tell them that you want to see examples of pictures that demonstrate excellent outcomes, average outcomes and outcomes that did not turn out as well as the surgeon had hoped for. we all have a variety of outcomes and its fair game for patients to ask to see them.You should also ask each surgeon what the revision rate is and what the revision policy is for this procedure.All the plastic surgeons should have a certain revision rate.You should also pay attention to how thorough the provider is for all aspects of the consultation including examination, review of the before and after pictures, setting correct expectations, reviewing medical and surgical history, preparation for surgery, recovery, discussion of risks and benefits as well as alternative procedures.Theres no correct number of consultations needed to find the best provider but I suggest patients start with a minimum of five consultations and consider scheduling many more unless you feel very comfortable you found the most talented and experienced provider for your needs in your community.Avoid virtual consultations whenever possible and always avoid traveling long distances for elective surgical procedures if at all possible.When in doubt continue scheduling more consultations.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Would I benefit from a traditional or extended tummy tuck? 6 ft 210 lb female w/ umbilical hernia and",/question/pasadena-california-tummy-tuck-extended-traditional-after-pregnancy-hernia-diastasis-recti

If you want the most secure, abdominal wall reconstruction that would include using mesh.That seems excessive in my opinion and I would skip trying to understand details or technical aspects of surgery and instead focus on the two variables that matter. Those are your candidacy for the procedure and the skill and experience of the provider.Understanding your own candidacy, for the procedure is the first step in the process. There are four variables to determine with someones abdomen looks like. These are abdominal skin laxity, excess, subcutaneous fat, muscle, separation, and excess visceral or intra-abdominal fat.

Theres no correct number of consultations needed but the more consultations you have the more likely you are to find the best provider. I suggest patient start by having at least five in person, consultations and consider scheduling more unless they have any Concerns about having found the best provider. During each consultation, your job is to get an assessment or confirm your assessment regarding your candidacy for the procedure and vet the provider. I recommend patients bring pictures of their own body, taken the same way plastic surgeons take before and after pictures preferably in printed format. Use pictures of your own body for reference when reviewing before and after pictures. Theres no point in seeing results of patients who have different body characteristics than your own. Candidacy after all, is half of what determines quality results. The other half is the scale of the provider.During each consultation, ask providers to open up their portfolio and show you their entire collection of before, and after pictures of patients who had similar body characteristics to your own. Ask providers to specifically show you examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes, and outcomes that did not turn out, as well as they had hoped for. Being shown a handful of preselected images, representing the best results of a providers career is completely insufficient to get a clear understanding of what average results look like or how many of these procedures anyone surgeon has actually performed. Learn what quality tummy tuck results look like. Look very carefully at the belly buttons about the results to make sure they consistently look natural. The incision should be set low following anatomical, contours naturally and evenly on both sides, leaving the torso looking balanced, attractive, and proportionate from all angles, including from behind. For a reference and experience provider should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 set a before, and after pictures of commonly performed procedures, like a full tummy tuck. Highly experienced surgeons fallen back up hundreds or potentially thousands of before, and after pictures of this common procedure.While providers will prefer to show you examples of their best work, this is not in your best interest. What your goal is to find out what the average results look like especially on previous patients who had similar body characteristics to your own.Different doctors have different techniques when it comes to muscle tightening. Some people do it quick and dirty, while others are meticulous and do it in a more formal approach. Ive seen everything from a single, running absorbable suture to interrupted figure of eight sutures, followed by a reinforcing, running suture on top of that. Some providers will even add mesh to reinforce the strength of the abdominal wall. I dont see how adding a horizontal muscle tightening layer is going to strengthen the vertical repair but perhaps your doctor knows something I dont. Ive never seen anybody else add horizontal muscle tightening so thats a new one for me. I have seen providers do muscle tightening on the oblique muscles but I question if this adds any benefit. The best surgeons I know do a standard tummy tuck. They are meticulous about their work and spend enough time to do it right. They have the skill and experience to know how to make a proper assessment, and I have to technically do the procedure correctly.

Liposuction does create some scar tissue that contracts and I would say the net and outcome is probably that there is no real skin improvement or worsening from Liposuction.Delivering consistent quality liposuction results is more difficult than most people believe and this includes plastic surgeons.Surprisingly high number of board-certified plastic surgeons with overall good reputations are not particularly talented at Liposuction so make sure that you find someone whos really good at the procedure.Liposuction results are permanent, irreversible and can lead to disfigurement if not done correctly.Women of had children who want to type flat admin generally are better candidates for a full tummy tuck but it doesnt appear you have significantly loose skin so in the end it depends on what youre trying to achieve.

Highly experienced surgeons will have hundreds or potentially even thousands of before and after pictures for commonly performed procedures.If youre content seeing only the preselected best results of the providers career youll have no idea what average results look like. All plastic surgeons will from time to time get an impressive result but this is not a reflection of an average results look like and you will not know until you see a variety of outcomes.Ask the surgeon to show you examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and less than outcomes. ask the surgeon with the revision rate is, what the revision policy is and asked to see pictures of other patients who needed the revisions and what their before and after pictures look like.Bring pictures of your own torso with you for comparison and I as the provider to shows many pictures as possible of patients with very similar body characteristics to your own.Make absolutely sure your provider is board-certified by the American Board of plastic surgery. No other board certification will do. especially not the American Board of cosmetic surgery which is not recognized by any academic medical training center in the world.Make sure the surgeon has operating room privileges and can do both tummy tucks and Liposuction.When reviewing before and after pictures look very carefully at all areas treated with Liposuction to make sure there are no skin contour irregularities anywhere on any of the pictures. Ask the surgeon to review the pictures with you and have them point out what areas were treated and what areas were not treated then look very carefully a transition zones between treated and untreated areas.Ask the surgeon to review the pictures with you and have them point out what areas were treated and what areas were not treated then look very carefully a transition zones between treated and untreated areas.For a fat transfer ask the surgeon specifically how long after the procedure the after pictures were taken. No one should be showing after pictures less than three months from the date of fat transfer. Early fat transfer pictures can look very impressive but do not at all represent the final results because it takes 3 to 6 months for the results to be final and a substantial amount of the fat will shrink and disappear during that time.When consulting for a tummy tuck look specifically and who gets the most natural looking belly buttons. This is one of the harder parts of the procedure so surgeons who get that right usually are detail oriented and are technically talented.Other characteristics of quality tummy tuck surgery include a very low set scar with a convex curvature over the mons pubis with the incisions going equally and evenly on both sides following anatomical contours naturally preferably placed in the groin crease. The torso should look attractive balanced and proportionate from all angles including from behind.Personally I view the torso as a single anatomic unit and when doing liposuction of the abdomen I typically include the entire torso. This means doing upper abdomen, lower abdomen, love handles all the way to the top of the hip dip, waist, entire back and under arm area all the way to the side of the breast. cheating the entire torso leaves patients with a natural even thin fat distribution that looks natural without having had any evidence of previous liposuction. Having part of your torso left untreated is a bit like painting three walls out of four when repainting a house.Finally I recommend reading all reviews and various physician review websites avoiding providers with any significant number of justified negative reviews. The absence of justify the negative reviews is more important and more telling than having an abundance of positive reviews.Continue having consultations until you feel quite certain you found the most talented and experience provider. they may happen after the second or third consultation or it may take over 10 consultations.I recognize this is a time consuming process but consider that poorly done Liposuction can leave you disfigured irreparably for life it is an effort that is completely justified.Cutting corners when it comes to vetting your plastic surgeon is just as bad as surgeons cutting corners when theyre doing your procedure.Unfortunately Ive seen both too many times.When in doubt slow down and schedule more consultations.Find the right plastic surgeon and everything falls into place.Ethical talented and highly experienced surgeons should not have any difficulty showing you as many pictures as you want including results that are less than what anybody had hoped for.We all have a variety of outcomes including results were not proud of.Its fair and appropriate for patients to see a full variety of outcomes and have an honest theyre a discussion about what they can expect, what can be done and what cannot be done with each procedure.Whenever possible stay local for elective surgical procedures.This is especially true for major operations like a tummy tuck.The success of fat grafting is primarily based on the presence or absence of sufficient host tissue to support the graft.If theres virtually no soft tissue in your hip dips then do not expect a substantial amount of fat to survive in the area.Your gluteal implants may potentially get in the way of successful grafting of the hips and often patients with hip dips who opt for gluteal implants have hip implants to match.Personally Im not a fan of gluteal implants or hip implants for that matter.The majority of plastic surgeons in the United States dont offer gluteal implants for a good reason.That is not to say you cant have fat transfer and move forward with your procedure.Gluteal implants have unfortunately high complication rate and undesirable side effect making them have not such a great long-term track record for long-term patient satisfaction.If youre happy with them and theyre working then dont mess with them.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Is lipo enough because it will give me skin retraction - what should I expect realistically?

1492237,question,,"At five months postop the implant position is not likely to change significantly. The fibrous capsules that naturally form around any implanted medical device are now well-established, so while I am sure it is not what you prefer to hear, it almost certainly will require a revisional surgery to improve your breast shape and to achieve a more aesthetically ideal positioning of the nipple-areola complexes (NACs). To provide a complete and accurate assessment of your current situation, one would need to review your preoperative photographs as well as some additional information (implant position relative to the pec major muscles, type of dual-plane dissection if performed, implant size and profile, etc), and of course perform a physical examination. You stated that you had low nipples to begin with, so clearly there was some element of preoperative ptosis (the medical term for droopiness, the p is silent). From the photos it appears that implants which are too projecting - and perhaps too large - were placed in too high a position. In profile this creates an unnaturally full upper pole (excessive roundness / projection in the cleavage area), and in the lower pole the appearance of a breast hanging off of the lower end of the implant. If the implants are subpectoral, an incomplete release of the inferior origin of the pectoralis major muscles may hold the implants in too high a position and contribute to this appearance. Patients with mild to moderate breast ptosis who seek breast augmentation with implants generally fall into three categories, which vary with the degree of breast ptosis and the degree of skin elasticity: 1.Will have a fairly ideal appearance with an augmentation alone, as implant pocket dissection and implant placement can be performed in a manner the rotates the NACs into a higher position on the breast mound (usually requires a conservative implant volume or the upper poles will appear too large/full).2.Will have an acceptable appearance overall with augmentation alone but the NACs will be relatively low on the breast mound; many moms of 2 or 3 are fine with this, as are patients who are absolutely opposed to breast lift scars (again implant volume should be conservative).3.Will have the appearance of breasts hanging off of implants and therefore absolutely require a mastopexy at the time of augmentation.Without reviewing your preop photos (and, more importantly, without actual physical examination), it is difficult to say with certainty what set of circumstances led to your current postop appearance. But from your photos and your description I think it is most likely that preoperatively you fell into category 1 or 2 above, and that your postoperative appearance at five months results from overly projecting, overly large breast implants being placed in too high a position. It sounds as though preoperative Vectra imaging led you (and perhaps your surgeon) to believe that the ultimate NAC position would be more aesthetically ideal. That is a problem inherent in computer imaging: it shows you a potential or possible result, but not necessarily the result that you will actually end up with. What you get depends on what happens in the operating room. Breast augmentation of the mild to moderately ptotic breast, without simultaneous mastopexy, is a surgical procedure that requires careful preoperative planning, thoughtful and usually conservative implant volume and profile selection, and meticulous attention to detail in the OR. It is also incumbent upon the surgeon to provide each patient with a clear understanding of the outcome they are likely to have. Rather than showing patients a computer-modified image of what they might look like postoperatively, I find it much more useful to show patients before and after images of actual surgical results where the preoperative appearance was similar to their own. This gives prospective patients a more meaningful impression of the kind of result they can expect depending on their own starting point. Your surgeon wants you to continue to wear a breast band for postop months 6 and 7 then return to the office for re-evaluation. If you have confidence in your surgeon based on your experience thus far, then wait it out and return at 7 months postop. If the appearance has not improved, then ask your surgeon what their plan would be for surgical revision. If you have lost some confidence, or if it would just provide you with some peace of mind to hear what someone else has to say, then it is probably worth seeking an opinion from another surgeon who is experienced in breast augmentation and breast augmentation revision surgery, and who has a large number of before and after images for these procedures which show results that are appealing to you.","Michael Law, MD answers: Will my implants fill out/drop more into my lower pole?

Suture material will weaken overtime and after 5 to 10 years will not have the strength it did when it was first put in.At that point scar tissue holds tissues in place and the suture material is no longer necessary.Some providers use slow absorbing absorbable suture which also stays in the body for a long time but it will eventually go away. even slow absorbing sutures lose their strength much more rapidly than permanent sutures.From a patients perspective there really is no difference between the two so surgeons rely on the most definitive long lasting suture material.Regardless of what material is used you will have internal sutures that will be present for a minimum of a few years. theres really no difference from a patients perspective.In the end the most important variable is choosing the most skilled and experienced provider.In the end there are only two variables that really matter when it comes to cosmetic surgery.They are patient candidacy and skill of the surgeon.Its patients focus on just those two variables and put in a thorough effort in finding the best provider the chance of having a positive long-term outcome and overall good experience is likely.Understanding your own candidacy for the procedure and with that recognizing what can and cannot be accomplished with these procedure including alternative procedures is an important part of high patient satisfaction.Choose the right provider by having multiple in person consultations.Start the process by first getting quality pictures of your torso taken the same way plastic surgeons take before and after pictures.Pictures should show your torso from your knees to your shoulders. have someone else take the pictures or use the timer on your camera with the camera about 8 feet away. Stand in a neutral position with pictures shoving your front, side and backside.When reviewing before and after pictures always select only patients who have similar body characteristics to your own.Look at lots of before and after pictures online on the sources like this website or plastic surgeons own websites. Create a rating or a grading system for what you believe our quality results. again focus only on patients who look like your body in the before pictures.Theres no point in looking at the results of patients who have a different body than you do in the before pictures.In regards to the abdomen there are generally for variables that determine what it looks like. These are abdominal skin laxity typically related to previous pregnancies or weight loss, excess subcutaneous fat, muscle separation from previous pregnancies and lastly excess intra-abdominal or visceral fat.A quality assessment should differentiate all four of those variables.A tummy tuck primarily treats abdominal skin laxity and muscle separation.If those are the two main variables that are keeping your abdomen Im looking the way you want the tummy tuck is most likely the correct procedure.If excess subcutaneous fat is an issue then weight loss or liposuction may be appropriate.Individuals who have excess visceral fat should lose weight in order to reduce the bulging of their abdomen and before considering a tummy tuck.Judge tummy tuck results primarily based on the following criteria.First and foremost is a natural appearing central abdomen and belly button. Creating a natural appearing belly button during a tummy tuck is one of the harder aspects of the procedure. Surgeons who can do this well consistently tend to be detail oriented and are willing to put in the work to get quality results.It takes time to do quality work. Ask your surgeons exactly how many hours the surgery will take.Surgeons who are detail oriented and are trying to get the best results without compromise will typically take 3 to 5 hours to do a full tummy tuck.Ive also seen plastic surgeons do the same procedure in 90 minutes or less. Those providers cut corners and results are compromised.Operating room and anesthesia costs typically go by the hour and are expensive.Reducing operating time can serve as a financial motivator for surgeons who are looking to maximize profits.What you want is a surgeon who is a patient advocate and is willing to take the time required to get the best results.The second variable after the central abdomen is the design of the incision.Incisions should be placed as low as possible. Ideally the incision should be in the groin crease. My preferred approach is to have the incision be slightly convex over the mons pubis then follow the groin crease gradually up over the hips. The incision should look like it follows anatomic contours naturally and evenly on both sides. Do not judge surgeons based on what the scar itself looks like since that is more related to how individuals heal and how long after surgery photographs are taken.Skin incisions take 12 to 18 months before they are fully mature and stop improving.Most after pictures are usually taken at six months at which time skin incisions have not fully matured.The torso should look attractive, balanced and appropriate from all angles including from behind.Individuals who have skin laxity that continues on the side or onto the back should have an extended procedure. those who have a fat distribution that is unbecoming without good feminine curves in the love handles should have liposuction done during the tummy tuck or as a separate procedure in order to have an attractive torso from all angles.If surgeons recommend doing liposuction of your backside in conjunction with the tummy tuck then you need to see before and after pictures of what that looks like.Its difficult to do quality liposuction of the waist and love handles with patients laying on their back. Its difficult to move patients after a tummy tuck and if somebody is adding liposuction including charging for it as an additional procedure then you should ask specifically in what position your body will be while they do liposuction.To get quality liposuction results of the love handles waist and back patients need to be turned either on their side or face down.Likewise individuals who need an extended tummy tuck with skin removal more than just the front of the abdomen also need to be turned during surgery.It should be made very clear during the consultation if you need an extended tummy tuck or not.If an extended tummy tuck is recommended then you should make sure the surgeon is planning on turning you during surgery.Insufficient skin excision on the sides and waist and individuals who have extensive skin laxity will result in a condition called dog ears. This results from an insufficient skin excision on individuals who have skin laxity that continues beyond just the front of the abdomen.Ask each provider to open up their portfolio and show you their entire collection of before and after pictures during in person consultations.Ask providers to only show you before and after pictures of patients who have similar body characteristics to yourself.Bring your own pictures for reference to make sure they are only showing you examples of patients whose body looks similar to yours.Theres no point in seeing impressive results on patients who were far better candidate for the procedure than you are.Candidacy for surgery is a spectrum.Typically the ideal candidate for a tummy tuck has only two variables keeping them from looking perfect. those two variables are the two variables treated by a full tummy tuck namely abdominal skin laxity and muscle separation. If there are other variables like excess subcutaneous fat, visceral fat or muscular skeletal structure that is less than ideal then candidacy will decrease.For example, barrel chested individuals who have a sternum that sits significantly in front of the pubic bone often end up with bulging of their upper abdomen after a full tummy tuck.Sufficiently experienced surgeon should be able to predict your results and tell you exactly what type of candidate you are for the procedure.During the consultation they should show you multiple before and after pictures of previous patients who are very similar body characteristics to your own.Ask providers to show you examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and outcomes that did not turn out as well as they had hoped.Ask providers what the revision rate is and what their revision policy is.Ask them whats the most common requested reason for a revision is.You should also ask what the complications are in regards to actual percentages and what having each of those complications will entail.The most common complication after a full tummy tuck is a seroma.You should ask each surgeon what theres seroma rate is as well as how they treat them.Fluid buildup or a seroma is reported to happen as often as 20% with this procedure.This complication is minimized by leaving drains in place long enough that fluid buildup do not occur after the removal of drains.Patients are typically not found of having drains in for long periods of time so it is always a balancing act.For reference an experience surgeon should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures of commonly performed procedures like a full tummy tuck.Providers may be apprehensive of showing you anything other than their best of their career before and after pictures.I think youll find that the most talented and experience surgeons will be the most open to showing you a variety of results and have no problem talking about variation in outcomes and being honest about complications.Your goal in the end is to find out what average results look like in the hands of each provider and previous patients who have your candidacy.Take notes during the consultation regarding both the quantity and quality of before and after pictures and especially how many matched your body type.You should also take notes about the overall thoroughness of the consultation regarding all aspects that should be discussed during a proper plastic surgery consultation.This includes at a minimum medical history, physical examination, assessment, review of recommended procedure and alternatives, review of before and after pictures, risks and benefits, preparation for surgery, recovery, complications and how they are treated, revision rates etc. etc. etc.Providers who have consultations done by anyone other than the actual surgeon whos going to do your procedure should be a major red flag.Start by scheduling at least five in person consultations with local board-certified plastic surgeons in your community.Avoid virtual consultations whenever possible.I highly recommend against traveling long distances for elective surgical procedures especially for a tummy tuck.Continue having consultations until you feel very comfortable do you find the most talented and experience provider for your needs.This may require more than five consultations.A full tummy tuck is a permanent and irreversible operation.If done poorly improving the results is almost impossible.This is especially true if the Central abdomen and belly button do not turn out well.A full tummy tuck involves a long incision including a scar around your belly button.You should consider your own skin healing history and take that into consideration and discuss that during consultations.Most people have had some skin injury or surgical procedure at some point in their life.Reviewing how each individual has healed in the past is very informative and making an assessment of how the scar will look long-term.Individuals who are prone to poor skin healing may want to consider not having this procedure.This includes people perform keloid or hypertrophic scars from minor injuries or previous surgeries or lacerations.When in doubt slow down and schedule more consultations.A full tummy tuck is probably the most invasive operation someone can have it for cosmetic purposes.The recovery can be intense and overwhelming. patients should go in to this process being well-informed and well prepared.This means being prepared physically, emotionally, financially and physiologically.In the end the most important variable is finding the right provider.In general there isnt much people can do to change their candidacy. The biggest exception of this is individuals who are obese.Obese individuals should seriously consider losing weight before considering having a tummy tuck.Individuals with a history of cigarette smoking should also seriously consider not having this procedure.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Are there risks associated with permanent sutures used for tummy tucks?",/question/houston-texas-permanent-sutures-muscle-repair-tummy-tucks-risks
12457694,question,,"To get the best looking body you should consider the following procedures in this order.The first procedure should be an extended 3/4 or circumferential tummy tech with a breast lift ideally adding at least small implants.A breast lift by itself will not give you great projection but adding even small implants will help with projection.The second procedure should be liposuction of your entire torso with fat grafting to your buttocks hips and outer thighs.I recommend doing the procedures in that order.Attempts at doing all of this as a single procedure would limit the potential quality out, and its simply too much work for anyone doing meticulous detail oriented surgery.Its critical you choose as officially skilled and talented provider.To find the right provider for your tummy tuck schedule in person consultations exclusively. Bring pictures of your own torso just like the ones youve posted except the pictures should be cropped from your neck to your knees. we need to see your thighs in order to make an assessment about your S-curve or the lack of one. We cant assess the torso without seeing the thighs.During each in person consultation ask each provider to open up their portfolio and show you their entire collection of before and after pictures.Ask them to show you only pictures of previous patients who are very similar body characteristics to your own.It should be people with significant skin laxity, moderate amounts of subcutaneous fat moderate muscle separation from previous pregnancies and some excess visceral fat. Being shown a handful of preselected pictures which most likely represent The best results of a providers career is insufficient to get a clear understanding of an average results look like or how many of these procedures a surgeon has actually performed.Your muscular skeletal structure lacks curves and is somewhat square. youre looking for people who have that same figure in the before pictures.Judge tummy tuck results based on who gets the most natural looking mid abdomen and belly button. getting natural looking belly buttons with a natural contour of the mid abdomen tends to be the hardest part of the procedure and surgeons who get that part right typically know what theyre doing. The second variable to judge tummy tucks by is a very lowest that scar that follows anatomic contours naturally preferably directly in the groin increase thats even on both sides. preferably the incision has a slightly convex curvature over the mons pubis. The third variable is looking at the torso from all angles making sure that the entire torso looks balanced appropriate and attractive from all angles including from behind. in your case you have skin laxity that continues around your sides and onto your backside. Do you have two skinfolds on your lower back. The lower one needs to be exercised as part of the wraparound tummy tuck. Youll probably be stuck with one skinfold on your lower back but one of them should be able to be eliminated.The discussion it needs to be very explicit and clear regarding the extent of the tummy tuck.An extended tummy tuck requires turning the patient during surgery.You need to see it clear examples of what an extended or wraparound tummy tuck looks like so youll have a good idea of the scar design and the extent of the incision.Its not possible to do an extended tummy tuck with a patient laying on their back during the entire procedure.Turning patient during general anesthesia its a fairly complex thing that takes time and is quite involved.It adds to the price but without doing an extended tummy tuck your torso will be left unbalanced and disproportionate.An experienced provider should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures of commonly performed procedures like a tummy tuck. Highly experienced surgeons will have hundreds or even thousands of before and after pictures of this commonly performed procedure. extended or wraparound tummy tucks are not as common and some providers are not experienced or prefer not to do them.Ask providers specifically to show you results of both extended and regular tummy tucks of previous patients who had the same body characteristics as your own.A provider with sufficient experience should have no difficulty finding representative before and after pictures of other patients who had similar body characteristics to your own.Ask the provider to show you examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and outcomes that did not turn out as well as they had hoped for.Ask them specifically what the revision rate is and what the revision policy is.For breast lift its basically the same thing except the design of incisions is fairly standardized and there isnt that much difference where the scars are placed. A breast lift is by no means a simplistic operation and breast lift results are simply based on attractive looking breasts that have areolas and nipple positions that are placed correctly with sufficient breast volume above and below the nipple.In your case you may want to consider having a breast reduction. while it sounds quite counterintuitive adding a small implant in conjunction with a breast reduction can give it a better aesthetic outcome. A breast reduction by itself will include a lift but typically leaves the breast flat against the chest wall without forward projection. adding a small implant will give the projection needed for a more aesthetically desirable breast.Breast reductions can be covered by medical insurance. You should talk to plastic surgeons to see if theyre willing to work with your medical insurance company to get authorization for a breast reduction if thats something youre interested in.Getting medical authorization for the breast reduction will significantly reduce operating room and anesthesia costs and can cover an overnight stay in a hospital or surgical facility that is otherwise very expensive and highly desirable after a full tummy tuck.Doing an extended tummy tuck as an outpatient procedure is a bit much for most people.Once youre healed up from those two procedures youll need to get a reassessment and then fine-tune the rest of your body with Liposuction and fat grafting. The second procedure may need to include some revision work to fine-tune the first procedure.To get the best results you will also need to lose weight.Without weight loss and your results will be inherently limited.Personally I do not like doing the BBL prior to the tummy tuck. The only exception is individuals who truly do not have enough fat for fat transfer after a tummy tuck.That is not the case for you so for you I would recommend doing the liposuction and fat transfer as a second procedure.Abdominal liposuction done as the first procedure or leave scar tissue through your subcutaneous fat layer that lowers pliability of your skin in fat layer limiting the potential outcome of your tummy tuck. different plastic surgeons have different opinions about the importance of doing the tummy tuck first versus liposuction first.My first hand experience has been that it is quite advantageous to not do a abdominal liposuction prior to a tummy tuck.Other surgeons recommend doing the liposuction and fat grafting work first. There are reasons for that as well.In the end the most important variable is to choose the most talented an experience provider.You may opt to choose a different provider for one set of procedures and a different provider for the other.Some plastic surgeons are better at some types of procedures than others.I would be very careful choosing providers for liposuction and fat transfer.Those procedures have more variation based on who does the surgery than any other plastic surgery procedures Ive ever seen.A substantial number of well trained board-certified plastic surgeons with overall good reputations failed to deliver consistent quality liposuction and fat transfer results.Doing these procedures well and consistent basis is more difficult than most people believe.Get accustomed to seeing quality results by reviewing lots of before and after pictures. Theres no point in looking at the results of patients who have different body characteristics to your own. Regardless of how much you like the outcomes you should only look at pictures of patients who look like you in the before pictures.Print copies of the pictures of your own body and look at those at the same time that you are reviewing before and after pictures.You need to be comparing patients of similar candidacy.Create a rating system of what you consider to be good average and not so good results.To find results that dont look the best you need to look at sources like patients posting with questions on this website.Most providers are not going to post their average or less than average results on their websites.You should however insist on seeing those types of results during in person consultations.All providers have results that didnt turn out as well as we had hoped and its fair game for patients to ask to see those types of pictures.You are the one hiring the plastic surgeon and you have a full right to demand documentation of various types of results before committing to surgery.Consulting with plastic surgeons is a skill that most people dont have much experience with.Plastic surgeons on the other hand have lots of experience giving consultations.This is one of the reasons I recommend patients have multiple consultations.Youll get better at the process and learn to be more assertive and ask for the information you need during each consultation as you get better at consulting.Please make sure you only consult with board-certified plastic surgeons.No other board certification is acceptable.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Which procedures would help me achieve a bikini body?

12630048,question,,"If patients are willing to, except the small vertical scar from the closure of the skin surrounding the belly button, then all individuals, regardless of skin laxity can have a full tummy tuck with a very low set incision. For individuals who have less skin laxity, and a higher vertical distance between the mons pubis and umbilicus it may not be possible to clear all the skin without adding the small incision.You are definitely a candidate for a full tummy tuck, and it is generally preferable to have a low set scar , even if it means adding the small vertical additional scar between the primary incision and the umbilicus.To find the right provider, I suggest, focusing on reviewing as many before, and after pictures during each in person consultation as possible. During each consultation, ask providers to open up their portfolio and show you their entire collection of before, and after pictures of previous patients who had similar body characteristics to your owner. Being shown a handful of preselected images, representing the best results of a providers career is totally insufficient to get a clear understanding of what average results look like or how many of these procedures anyone surgeon has actually done. As provider specifically to only show you before and after pictures of previous patient who look like you do. And experience plastic surgeon should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 settle before and after pictures of common procedures like a full tummy tuck. As providers to specifically show you variation in outcomes, including excellent outcomes, average outcomes, and outcomes that did not turn out, as well as they had hoped.

Judge Tammy, tucker results based on who gets the most natural looking belly button with a very low, said scar that follows anatomic contours naturally and evenly on both sides. The torso should be left, looking balanced, attractive, and proportionate from all angles, including from behind.Take an active role during the consultation to vets plastic surgeons to make sure you choose the best provider. The hallmarks of a quality tummy tuck are generally based on getting a natural looking belly button with the correct design of the incision.Become familiarized with what quality results should look like by reviewing hundreds of before, and after pictures on this website, looking particularly for patients who have similar body characteristics to your own in the before pictures. Once you have a good idea of what quality results look like, create a reading scale and judge plastic surgeons results based on your knowledge of what quality results should look like. Take careful notes during each consultation regarding the quality and quantity of before and after pictures. Take notes about the thoroughness each surgeon displayed during the consultation regarding all aspects of a proper formal consultation, including review, medical history, physical examination, assessment, description of recommended procedures, alternative procedures, explanation of risks and benefits, and what those risks entails, including previous complication the surgeon has had doing this procedure. You should never feel apprehensive about having a follow up, secondary consultation with the same provider if you still have unanswered questions.Theres no excuse for not showing you an over abundance of before and after pictures.Sufficiently experienced and talented providers should have the experience and confidence to show you a variety of outcome. We all have different outcomes. Some are better than others, and its fair game for patients to ask to see different types of results, including ones that are less than perfect.The alternative to having the small vertical scar may be placing the incision higher on the abdomen. In my opinion, this is an undesirable aesthetic choice and its far better to keep the incision right in the groin, crease and accept the vertical scar small. I generally recommend patients have multiple in person consultations before scheduling surgery. For most patients and most procedures, I recommend starting by having at least five in person consultations. Youll be living with the result, and be reminded of your outcome every day for the rest of your life. Spending extra time consulting with more providers his time well spent considering the potential consequence. A full tummy tuck is an absolute irreversible and definitive operation. Once performed, it is very difficult to improve on the outcome.. In the end, the only two variables that are of significant importance, dissipation, candidacy, and the choice of provider. Youre definitely an excellent candidate, and should expect a very high quality tummy tuck. Based on that there is now only one more variable and that is finding the best provider. Make sure you have consulted with all major players in your community before you choose your surgeon.Insist on seeing sufficient numbers of before, and after pictures to get a clear understanding of what average results look like in the hands of each provider.Theres simply no excuse for not having a sufficient collection of before and after pictures, if you claim to be a skilled and experienced provider.In reality a highly experienced provider should have hundreds or even thousands of before, and after pictures of commonly performed procedures that should be done on a weekly basis. If someone does a tummy tuck per week, then they should have at least 50 sets of before and after pictures for this procedure for each year of practice.Best,Mats Hagstrom, MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Do I have enough skin for a full tummy tuck?

12387884,question,,"Plastic surgeons try to not create parallel scars. The skin between two long parallel scars will have restricted blood flow and can lead to an increased chance of developing skin necrosis and wound healing complications.There are no absolutes and plastic surgeons will take many variables into consideration. The length of the first scar, the position of it, is the patient a smoker or have any history of tobacco abuse or nicotine use, Obesity and overall health.Pyloric stenosis is usually done with a fairly small incision and this should by itself not create a substantial risk.A very long open gallbladder incision or an incision along both sides of the upper abdomen could potentially substantially increase the risk.In the end surgeons will take all variables into consideration and make a decision or recommendation based on that.Cigarette smoking is probably the greatest risk factor and probably trumps significance parallel scars when it comes to increased when healing complications from this procedure.If you have no history of cigarette use or use nicotine products then youre probably in a pretty safe place in regards to complications.The amount of tension that is put on the skin and the aggressiveness of the procedure also are variables that need to be taken into consideration.Undermining or the separation of tissue layers which is done during a tummy tuck may conceivably be restricted in someone who has certain risk factors.Personally I see no indication for adding a full vertical incision or adding a fleur-de-lis design. you look like a textbook tummy tuck candidate and a standard tummy tuck should be completely sufficient.I highly recommend having multiple consultations.

Ask them specifically to show you as many examples of patients who have similar body characteristics to your own. seeing patients with previous scars is not necessary but look at the other variables like overall size, obesity, degree of skin laxity and muscle separation. get familiar with what quality tummy tuck results look like.

Blending the improved tight front of the abdomen with hips and waist should look balanced and proportionate.Ideally the incision should be slightly convex over the mons pubis area and be set in the groin crease.Pay very close attention to the belly button. does it look natural, is it well placed, is the contour of the central abdomen look natural?Getting consistent natural looking belly buttons is probably the hardest part of the procedure. Doing so requires finesse and a purposeful effort. Getting quality results takes time and the best plastic surgeons are never rushed but will take the time necessary to get consistent quality results. asking how many hours the operation will take is probably not a bad idea. doing quality work is going to take several hours. six hours is unnecessary and an hour and a half is probably cutting corners everywhere you can.Ask each surgeon about the revision rates and what the revision policy is.Ask surgeons to show you examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and less than outcomes.We all have a variety of outcomes and its fair game for patients to ask to see a variety of results.An experience provider should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures of commonly perform procedures like a full tummy tuck. highly experienced surgeons will have hundreds or even thousands of before and after pictures of this procedure.Finally I recommend reading all the reviews and various physician review websites avoiding providers with any significant number of justified negative reviews. The absence of justified negative reviews is more important in the more telling than having an abundance of positive reviews.Obviously in your case talk about the impact of your previous surgery. Im guessing most plastic surgeons will be very comfortable moving forward with a standard Tummy tuck.The exception would be if you have a history of cigarette use.Continue having consultations until you feel quite certain you find the most talented an experienced surgeon who is thorough and explanation of the procedure preparation and recovery.Ideally they should be presenting a collection a before and after pictures that seems endless.The absence of justified negative reviews and a collection of before and after pictures that reads like a telephone book is probably the quintessential hallmarks of the surgeon youre looking for.Obviously a sense of patient candidacy, honesty and ethics is also needed.Take an active role in vetting plastic surgeons.

12520165,question,,"The process should begin with an assessment. an assessment is another word for making a diagnosis.In regards to the abdomen there are four variables that determine what the abdomen looks like. in other words if somebody doesnt like the way their belly looks it is always because of one or more of for different reasons.Each of these four variables is treated differently so which variable is contributing the most has a big impact on what is the best procedure.The four variables are 1) abdominal skin laxity typically related to previous pregnancies, weight fluctuations or possibly due to age2) muscle separation from previous pregnancies called Diastasis rectii, 3) excessive subcutaneous fat(The fat layer between your skin and muscle that you can feel when you pinch your skin), 4) excess visceral or intra-abdominal fat(fat around your internal organs that can only be reduced with weight loss).To make a good assessment we definitely need to know your GYN history or if youve had previous pregnancies.A tummy tuck primarily treats abdominal skin laxity and muscle separation. It will reduce subcutaneous fat to some degree on the front of the abdomen. Liposuction reduces subcutaneous fat only. Visceral fat can only be reduced with weight loss.If you feel like the change in your abdomen or what you dont like is changes related to previous pregnancies than a tummy tuck is most likely the best procedure. its important to differentiate muscle separation from excess visceral fat because they can both cause the abdominal wall to bulge. One way to differentiate if the abdominal wall is bulging due to muscle separation or visceral fat is just simply lay on your back and see if your abdomen goes flat.You dont appear to have a lot of skin laxity so Liposuction is an option. Recognize that if the problem stemmed from pregnancies then the tummy tuck is probably still the best treatment. Having children does not change fat distribution.Liposuction may be an option but if you want a tight flat abdomen and a full tummy tuck is probably the better procedure. A tummy tuck versus liposuction are two very different procedures to do different things.On your pictures it looks like you have bulging of your muscle wall so Im guessing you probably have muscle separation but as mentioned earlier it is important to make sure that visceral fat is not contributing. If it is then weight loss is mandatory if you want to look better and get a good tummy tuck results.A typical full tummy tuck will remove most of the skin of the lower abdomen from the top of the belly button all the way down to the pubic area or the groin crease this will lower your tattoo to right above your mons pubis. There are slight variations depending on each individuals amount of skin laxity and slight variations based on how each surgeon does the procedure.Prices for cosmetic surgery seem to be going up. when looking at prices do you need to know if the price includes the operating room, anesthesiologist and a recovery suite.A formal operating room with an anesthesiologist can easily cost $1000 per hour. Quality plastic surgeons who are meticulous and detail oriented are going to require time to do their work. its not unreasonable for a surgeon to take over four hours to do a really high-quality tell me tuck especially on a larger individual. ive seen surgeons do them in less than 1 1/2 hours but those results were dismal and the surgeon cut corners everywhere they could.In the San Francisco Bay area a tummy tuck by a reputable surgeon who does quality work its probably gonna be closer to $25,000 all inclusive.Fees vary based on geographic location, who does the procedure and facility fees. In the end there are only two variables to determine the outcome of this operation.The first is the patients candidacy and the second is the skill and experience of the surgeon.The procedure should be considered permanent and irreversible.If done poorly there are not a lot of things that can be done to improve the outcome.Judge take me to act results based on who gets the most natural looking mid abdomen and belly buttons first and foremost. The second thing to look at is the design of the scar. Discard should be sad very low, follow and a timer contours naturally and evenly leaving the torso with a balanced attractive appropriate appearance from all angles including the back side. I recommend having multiple in person consultations with local board-certified plastic surgeons in your community. During each consultation ask each provider to open up their portfolio and show you their entire collection of before and after pictures. ask surgeons to only show you before and after pictures of patients who had similar body characteristics to your own.Ask providers to show you a variety of outcomes including excellent outcomes, average outcomes and outcomes that did not come out as well as they had hoped. Ask specifically what does surgeons revision rate is and what their revision policy is.You should also ask what complication the surgeon has had with this procedure and how youll be managed if you end up with any of those complications.The most common complication is a fluid buildup after surgery called the seroma. This is not an uncommon complication. You should ask each provider exactly how they are going to manage a seroma if it occurs. For reference an experience surgeon should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures of commonly performed procedures like a full tummy tuck.Surgeons may be apprehensive to simply open up their portfolio and show you all of the results.Instead they will most likely prefer to show you a handful of preselected images representing the best results of their career. Ring pictures of your own torso taking the same way plastic surgeons take before and after pictures. This means having someone else take the picture or use the timer on your camera. take the pictures from about 8 feet away standing in a neutral position showing your front, side and backside sent me your shoulders to your knees. we need to see your entire body to put things into context and perspective. The abdomen blends into the thighs and what your lower extremities look like has a lot to do with what your abdomen should look like.Bring printed copies of pictures of your body with you during the consultation and use those as a reference. have those pictures out when youre reviewing before and after pictures and insist that the surgeon only shows you previous patients who had similar body characteristics to your own. an experienced provider should have hundreds (for some surgeons thousand) of before and after pictures to choose from so this should not be difficult.Take notes about the overall thoroughness of the consultation especially of the before and after pictures. Making notes about the quality and quantity of before and after pictures shown.Get familiar with what quality time in tech results look like and begin grading results so that you know a good outcome when you see one.When looking at before and after pictures whether at home or during a consultation always make sure the patient in the before picture has similar body characteristics to yourself.There is no point of looking at results of patients who had a completely different candidacy than you do.Start by having five in person consultations and consider scheduling more unless you feel very comfortable you found a surgeon with sufficient skillet experience for your needs.When in doubt slow down and schedule more consultations.Find the right plastic surgeon and everything falls into place.This operation is permanent and irreversible.If done poorly results cannot be improved substantially through revision surgery.Good luck,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Am I a tummy tuck candidate & how low will my tattoo be pulled down?

An assessment should address each of those four variables and the choice of procedure should be made depending on what is the primary, secondary and tertiary underlying problem.The four variables are abdominal skin laxity typically due to previous pregnancies or weight fluctuations, excess subcutaneous fat, muscle separation from previous pregnancies called diastasis recti. and lastly excess visceral or intra-abdominal fat.To differentiate skin laxity pull up on your abdominal skin until its tight and see if it improves the contour.To measure the thickness of subcutaneous fat gently push against your skin whats the tip of your finger until you feel the underlying muscle wall. It does not require much pressure at all. Its a very gentle touch. Most likely your subcutaneous fat layer is about one and a half inches. You can expect Liposuction to remove 75% of that fat.A straight abdominal muscle wall should create a B line between your sternum and pubic bone.You can use your own hands to feel both your sternum and pubic bone and then field where your muscle ball is the same way you check the thickness of your subcutaneous fat layer and see how much its bulging.A bulging abdominal wall represents either muscle separation, visceral fat or both.To differentiate between visceral fat and muscle separation see how much pressure it requires to press your abdomen flat or try laying on your back and see if your abdomen goes completely flat while laying on your back.If the abdomen still bulges while laying on your back visceral fat is most likely contributing significantly.In regards to treatment options a full tummy tuck primarily treats muscle separation and skin laxity. it will reduce subcutaneous fat on the front of your abdomen to some degree by pulling the skin and fat layer tight just like a rubber band becomes thin when you pull it tight.Visceral fat can only be lost through weight loss and subcutaneous fat can be reduced with weight loss or liposuction.Based on your pictures you have significant muscle separation, moderate skin laxity possible excess visceral fat and are the quintessential ideal tummy tuck candidates.Liposuction will not address the muscle separation or bulging abdominal wall and therefore is limited. It will bring in the front of your abdomen by 1 inch maximum.Liposuction is however the best treatment for contouring the waist, love handles, back and under arm area.Delivering consistent quality liposuction results is more difficult than most people believe and this includes the majority of plastic surgeons.The majority of plastic surgeons have not mastered this procedure that is often unfortunately viewed as simplistic and unsophisticated. In reality being able to deliver consistent quality body contouring results using Liposuction with accurate assessment an accurate predictions of consistent outcomes is far more difficult. Mastering Liposuction requires a purposeful commitment to excellence with having had experience of doing preferably thousands of cases.Youll find that the more talented someone is doing a procedure the morning respect they have for how difficult it is to master it completely.Those who view liposuction as a simple internal operation will never be great at doing liposuction.The diversity in outcomes based purely on who does the procedure varies more for Liposuction than any other plastic surgery operation.For that reason patients should take the selection process of providers quite seriously and put in their due diligence when it comes to vetting plastic surgeons to find the most talented and experience provider for their needs.I recommend doing this by scheduling multiple in person consultations preferably with local board-certified plastic surgeons.Whenever possible avoid virtual consultations.During each consultation ask each provider to open up their portfolio and show you their entire collection of before and after pictures. Ask especially to see as many pictures as possible of patient was very similar body characteristics to your own.A thorough consultation should ideally include expression of each of the tissue components described above.Look very carefully at the results pictures making sure none of the areas treated have any skin contour irregularities. Ask the surgeons to point out what areas for treated and what areas were not treated and look very carefully a transition zones between treated and untreated areas. you may need to have the plastic surgeon help you with this.Bring with you pictures of your own torso taken in the same way plastic surgeons take before and after pictures after tummy tuck or liposuction surgery. you can use pictures of your own body as a reference for finding similar body types and comparison.An experienced provider should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures. highly experienced surgeons will have hundreds or even thousands of before and after pictures of commonly done procedures.To assess or judge plastic surgeons for the outcomes of a full tummy tuck look carefully at which plastic surgeons get the most natural looking belly buttons on a consistent basis. That tends to be one of the harder parts of the procedure and surgeons who dont get consistent good looking belly buttons tend to be better at the procedure. other characteristics of a quality tummy tuck include a very low with a side scar with a slightly convex curvature over the mons pubis with the incisions following anatomic contours naturally and even on both sides with the torso looking balanced attractive and appropriate from all angles including from behind.Become familiar with what quality results should look like from both Liposuction and a full tummy tuck so you have a reference form judging providers during consultations.Continue having consultations until you feel quite comfortable you found the right plastic surgeon for your need.When in doubt slow down and schedule more consultations.While a full tummy tuck is probably a better procedure for you youll also find that plastic surgeons were not comfortable or have the skill to deliver consistent quality Liposuction results will immediately steer away from recommending Liposuction and only promote a tummy tuck.In the end a full tummy tuck may be a better procedure but theres not to say that everyone who is a candidate for a tummy tuck should have one. In the end the procedure you choose should be based on being well-informed understanding the problems and what each procedure can and cannot accomplish.After that the decision it should be based on what youre trying to achieve and what youre willing to go through.Weight loss will always make you a better candidate for a tummy tuck and a will to some degree reduce your candidacy for liposuction since weight loss will reduce subcutaneous fat on its own. Weight loss will however not change the fat distribution it just reduces the overall amount of body fat.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: 13 stone 7lbs, 5'3, age 38, 38H, how successful would lipo be or is it better to have a tummy tuck?

12459457,question,,"There are a few points that can be fairly criticized about your outcome.First and foremost in order to make a quality assessment on the outcome of a procedure we always need to see proper before and after pictures.If you dont have before pictures then ask your surgeon to send the ones they took.Overall your tummy tuck looks pretty typical. The things that couldve been done differently if this set the incision much lower. when we remove all the skin and the fat from the lower abdomen there is usually a difference in the thickness of the subcutaneous fat in the groin area compared to the mid abdomen around the belly button. when we go to re-approximate the skin edges after cutting out the extra skin theres often a mismatch between the thickness of subcutaneous fat.The lower you make the incision the more about the subcutaneous fat mismatch there is. This can be adjusted by removing fat on the upper skin edge so it matches the thickness of the fat on the lower skin edge. in your case that was not done and there is a step off that demonstrates this abrupt change in thickness of subcutaneous fat which before surgery was more gradual.Liposuction may help even out the step off by reducing the thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer at and above the scar.It would however be nice to lower the incision as well.Personally Id like to make a convex incision around the mons pubis then continue the incision right in the groin increase.Doing this would include having to make a new opening for your belly button and the older opening would result in a small vertical scar between your belly button and your main incision.The easiest revision would be Liposuction but The total impact would not be as good as resetting the scar in a lower position.There also appears to be slight bulging of your lower abdomen.Its unusual for plastic surgeons to not deal with sufficient muscle tightening during this procedure.Seeing what your muscle wall looked like and preoperative pictures would shed some light on this as wood doing an examination.The overall contour of your lower abdomen is most likely a combination of the shape of your muscle wall and the sun degree remaining subcutaneous fat.Liposuction could probably bring in your lower abdomen by about 1 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch.Each plastic surgeon has their own way of designing tummy tuck incisions.Look for results by other providers that have more impressive looking incision designs to get an idea of who you may want to consult with for a revision.Having your own provider do the revision may serve as a source of cost savings but youve already seen how that person does the procedure.Tummy tech should be considered a permanent and irreversible operation.The time to properly vet plastic surgeons is ideally before your operation.I recognize it is now after the fact but the process of finding providers to do secondary procedures or revision work is more or less the same as finding providers for doing primary procedures.Start by looking at lots of plastic surgeons websites in your community and make note of who has the greatest quantity and quality of tummy tuck results.Look specifically at who gets the most natural looking belly buttons, a very lowest that scar that follows an atomic contours naturally and evenly on both sides with a Torso looking balanced proportionate and attractive from all angles including from behind.Bring pictures of your own torso taken the same way plastic surgeons take before and after pictures including pictures showing your body from behind to the consultations.Before consulting create a rating system or a grading system for quality results specifically in regards to natural looking belly buttons and a quality designed incision.During each in person consultation ask each provider to open up their portfolio and show you their entire collection of before and after pictures.Being shown a handful of preselected images which must likely represent the best results of the providers career is insufficient to get a clear understanding of what average results will look like or how many of these procedures that surgeon has actually performed.For a reference and experience surgeon should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures of commonly performed procedures like a tummy tuck.Ask providers to show your only pictures of previous patients who are very similar body characteristics to your own.Other patients who had different body shapes will have a different potential outcome and are not good representative images.Ask the provider to show you examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and outcomes that didnt turn out as well as they had hoped for.We all have a variety of outcomes and its fair game for patients to ask to see these type of results.Providers may be reluctant to open up at their portfolios and to show you anything other than their past results. regulars that youre the one in charge of deciding who is going to do your procedure and insist on getting the information you need to make a well educated decision.Make it clear to the provider that your decision of who you choose will be based in large part based on providers showing honesty and being willing to show up variety of outcomes and sufficient quantity of results to clearly demonstrate what average results look like.Make notes and spend plenty of time looking at the before and after pictures and give scores or rate each one including the number of pictures the provider shows you.You should also make a note of how thorough the surgeon is regarding all aspects of a proper consultation including review of medical history, examination, assessment, review of before and after pictures, preparation for surgery, discussion of recovery, risks and benefits etc. etc.You should always ask what each surgeons revision rate and revision policy is.Most people do not have a lot of experience consulting with plastic surgeons. Plastic surgeons on the other hand have lots of experience.Recognize that you were the one paying for the procedure and you have a right to vet the provider just like youre hiring someone to work for you.Theres no correct number does anyone need to find the right provider for any particular procedure. there is a substantial difference in outcome in regards to consistency and quality among different providers. The difference in outcome on some procedures can be substantial. this includes providers who all have for training, board certification and overall good reputations.To find the most talented and experience provider requires vetting multiple providers. The more providers you interview the better of your chance of finding the best provider for your needs.The process requires time and dedication but considering the impact I think its worth the effort.Attempting shortcuts by having virtual consultations will lessen the chance of finding the right provider.I think most patients should probably start with around five consultations and considering scheduling many more unless they feel very comfortable having found the right provider.Patients should have a very good idea of what the results would look like by having been shown lots of before and after pictures of previous patients who are very similar body characteristics to your own.You could go back and follow up with your provider and ask him or her to do your revision or you could get second opinion consultations.The cost of the procedure is in many ways not related to the quality outcome.Overall your tummy tuck result is probably very typical and should be considered an average result done by an average surgeon.Ive seen better and Ive seen worse results.The recovery from revision work may or may not be in part with what your first procedure was like.If the score is lowered then you will most likely need drains. If muscle tightening is done then expect the same level of discomfort during the recovery.Tell me a joke that does not include muscle tightening as a far easier recovery in regards to pain and intensity then if muscle tightening is involved.A simple revision that doesnt include changing the position of the scar but simply making the contour even whether done with open surgery or by Liposuction will have a very easy recovery that should only put you back a few days and should not require placement of a drain.Talk to your surgeon to see what he or she feels they can do and are willing to offer you and consider also consulting with other providers to get a more accurate assessment and better understanding of treatment options in regards to secondary procedures or revision work.For a second opinion consultations come prepared to bringing with you all before and after pictures and a copy of your operative report. These are available from your surgeons office if you request them.Good luck,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: 5ft, 132lbs, is lower belly pooch 7 months post tummy tuck something that can be fixed?

953183,question,,"
	Textured implants are designed to adhere to the tissues, which is one reason I believe textured implants have no place when used below the muscle. Textured surfaces were developed in the late 1980's when most implants were placed below the breast (ABOVE the muscle) and there was a much higher incidence of capsular contracture.

	We now know that CC occurs primarily in the settings of bleeding and bacterial biofilm formation. Below the breast positioning (above muscle) exposes the implants to significant numbers of intraductal bacteria, and smooth implants in this location allowed the bacteria to move freely along and around the smooth implant surface. Implant surface texturing provided adherence, isolating bacteria into localized macro-pockets between the irregular textured surface peaks and valleys, while also breaking-up vector forces of collagen and myofibroblast contraction. Some studies have shown that texturing seems to reduce capsular contracture in submammary implant placement; other studies are less convincing.

	When the FDA restricted use of silicone gel implants in 1991, plastic surgeons were forced to use primarily saline implants for cosmetic augmentation, but when used in the above-muscle position most of us were used to, patients began to notice rippling and water-balloon feel, so most plastic surgeons started placing implants below the muscle. Including those who used textured implants above the muscle.

	However, below the muscle there is significantly less bacterial contamination, since the breast ducts are above the muscle. Less CC occurred, and some PS felt this was due to their use of textured implants rather than the much-lower bacterial load of the submuscular position. However, some degree of lateral breast movement is natural when reclining, and only smooth implants allow that. Textured implants cannot move, and only the (small amount) of your own natural breast tissue moves, even less so if you have CC.

	I am explaining this so you understand that even though it is a surgeon's (and patient's) choice as to smooth or textured, and above or below the muscle, there should be some degree of thought and reasoning behind the decision other than This is the way I've been taught or That is how my professor did it or that's what my girlfriend has and hers look nice. Habits are bad when new information or better science goes unnoticed. Clinging to old ideas out of stubbornness or routine is equally wrong. But back to you.

	Your implants are too narrow (full projection=high profile) for your breast base width, giving you the curve and swell under your arm and the wide cleavage you mentioned earlier. Texture has prevented them for dropping into better downward position over time (as smooth implants would), and rippling is evident because your implants are soft and you have not developed CC. Even silicone implants can have some rippling, though generally much less than saline, and much less than above the muscle.

	Your result isn't bad, but you aren't happy either. You would have better results with smooth round implants below the muscle in a wider profile implant choice. If you like your size, then (for sure) you need mod + or even wider moderate profile implants; if you would prefer bigger, then the larger implant size will have a correspondingly wider base and moderate may still be best, or more likely a moderate + profile.

	Time won't help your result because of the adherence of your textured implants--they can't settle or drop into better position, not to mention being better in the cleavage area or less in the under arm areas. I'm sorry to tell you that revision seems to be in your future if you remain unhappy with your present appearance. I'd suggest consultation with additional ABPS-certified plastic surgeons experienced in breast surgery, and hear their philosophies about the choices they make, and why.

Your pictures are a bit limited but based on those I am not sold that you need a BBL. You can have Liposuction or alternatively you can also work on losing weight.I think most plastic surgeons would be happy to do liposuction for you. With quality reduction of your love handles waste back, upper and lower abdomen your bottom will proportionately already become larger.Delivering consistent quality results for these procedures is more difficult than most people believe. The number of plastic surgeons who can deliver consistent quality results as A minority of providers.A substantial number of plastic surgeons think they are far better at both Liposuction and fat chance for that they actually are.Liposuction with or without fat transfer has more variability based purely on which provider the patient juices and any other surgical procedure Ive ever seen.Finding the right provider is paramount and the single most important variable.To do that I recommend patients have multiple in person consultations with local board-certified plastic surgeons in their community.I do not recommend patients have virtual consultations and I do not recommend patients travel long distances for elective surgical procedures.During each consultation you need to get an accurate assessment as to your own candidacy for the procedure. this means differentiating all the other tissue variables that are not related to or are not treated by Liposuction. these include skin laxity for the loss of skin elasticity, potential pregnancy related changes like muscle separation and the presence or absence or absence of visceral fat.You will also need to accurately vent the providers to be able to pick the most talented and experienced one for your procedure.Like I said earlier choosing the right provider is the most important variable and getting this decision right is the difference between quality outcomes you can be proud of you for the rest of your life or regret and youll be reminded of every day for the rest of your life.During each in person consultation ask each provider to open up your portfolio and show you their entire collection of before and after pictures for Liposuction and if youre interested in the BBL and then then BBL as well.You should also ask providers what the revision rate is and what the revision policy is should you need one. Recognize that a BBL is two procedures done at the same time. It is Liposuction and fat transfer.Its possible that someone can be a good candidate for Liposuction but not a good candidate for fat transfer. The opposite is also possible or someone could be a good candidate for fat transfer but not a good candidate for Liposuction. someone could be a good candidate for both or not a good candidate for either.There are a lot of variables to take in the consideration and they should all be discussed thoroughly during a proper in person consultation.Being shown a handful of preselected pictures which most likely represent the best results of a providers career is totally insufficient to get a clear understanding of what average results look like in the hands of each provider or how many of these procedures the surgeon has actually performed.This is why patients need to push providers to open up your entire portfolio and start showing you lots of pictures.Ask specifically to only see pictures of previous patients who had similar body characteristics to your own.Ask the provider to show you examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and outcomes that did not turn out as well as they had hoped for it. We all have a variety of outcomes and its fair game for patients to ask to see them.For reference and experience surgeon should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures of a commonly performed procedures of which abdominal liposuction and gluteal fat transfer definitely are.Become familiarized with quality results by reviewing lots of pictures of both liposuction and BBL results before hand.Choose only images having people who have very similar body characteristics to your own in the before pictures.To do that you need to start by having a set of proper pictures of your own body take them the same way plastic surgeons take before and after pictures.Have someone else take the pictures or use the timer on your camera. Picture should be taken from about 8 feet away standing in a neutral position with your arms down showing your front, side and back side. wear revealing undergarments and crop the pictures from your neck to your knees. Look for other patients who have the same degree of skin laxity and approximately the same amount of obesity and overall proportions.Create a reading system for quality results.Bring your printed copies of pictures of yourself to use for reference when reviewing before and after pictures during the consultation.That way you can compare to make sure the provider is showing people that look like you and the before pictures to get an accurate understanding of what the procedure can and cannot accomplish.When looking at after pictures look very carefully at every area treated to make sure there are no skin contour irregularities anywhere.Ask the provider exactly what areas were treated and what areas were not.Its also important to have a very clear understanding of exactly what areas are going to be treated and what areas will not be treated. You need to see quality before and after pictures depicting impressive results for every area youre paying for.Personally I view the entire torso as a single anatomic unit and try to treat the entire torso when doing abdominal liposuction.Technically a full tour so when it comes to subdividing Liposuction anatomic units would include upper abdomen, lower abdomen, love handles, waste, entire back and under arms all the way to the side of the breast. sometimes the front bra roll, mons pubis and lower back are included as well.For the BBL different plastic surgeons have very different views on what an attractive female tour so it should look like. There Are plastic surgeons who purposefully do liposuction of the outer thigh to help make the buttocks look larger. This completely destroys the natural S-curve a perfect female figure should have that goes from the armpit to the knee. Some of the extreme caricature results some providers are creating are highly undesirable and extremely difficult to correct ones performed.Results should look natural and they should be viewed seeing the entire torso including lower extremities down to the knees.Theres no set number of consultations someone has to have to find the right provider but I am quite convinced the only way to do it is to interview and have in person consultations with quite a few of them.A talent provider can make an accurate assessment tell you exactly what kind of candidate you are and then show you representative before and after pictures accurately depicting exactly what they can and cannot deliver.I suggest patient start with at least five consultations and continue scheduling many more if needed.If done poorly these procedures can leave people disfigured and correcting poor Liposuction results is more or less impossible.When in doubt slow down and schedule more consultations.In the meantime consider losing weight which will get you looking better without having to have surgery.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Sickle cell SC - am I a candidate for cosmetic surgery?

12484399,question,,"To make an assessment we are the absolute minimum have to see proper pictures of your body.Call people form visible scars after skin surgery. Invisibility or house Bars hell depends on the multitude of variables. It depends first and foremost on each individual persons genetic make up and skin complexion.Some people form highly visible scars that at their worst can become thick like a rope as in those who form a keloid scars.For others scars can feed out to a faint white line that looks almost invisible.The part of the body with the surgery is being done also contributed greatly to what the scars will look like. Thick skin tends to heal the worst wild thin skin tends to heal with less scar tissue. Islands for example tend to leave very thin faint scars that are often minimally visible.Eyelids have some of the thinnest skin in the body.The upper back has some of the thickest skin on the body and the scars in this area tend to be highly visible.Liposuction permanently changes someones fat distribution. If your fat distribution is not ideal then liposuction can help improve that.Liposuction results when done in conjunction with a full tummy tuck often Im not as good as Liposuction results when Liposuction is done as a single primary procedure.There are a number of reasons for this.In order to contour the waist, love handles and back properly patients cannot be laying on their back. some surgeons are apprehensive to move patients during general anesthesia because doing so is fairly involved and time consuming. Aggressive liposuction can also increase certain complication rates when done in conjunction with a tummy tuck.Delivering consistent quality liposuction results is more difficult than most people believe and the number of plastic surgeons who can consistently perform reproducible quality results is smaller than most people think.Liposuction is a more difficult procedure to do well consistently than most people realize and this includes a substantial number of plastic surgeons. liposuction results are permanent and irreversible.Anyone considering Liposuction should be highly selective of their provider.Sometimes plastic surgeons add small amounts of liposuction to help shape a tummy tuck and this may or may not be included in doing the tummy tuck or may be priced as a separate procedure. sometimes patients truly benefit from liposuction and without doing quality liposuction the results will not be nearly as good as with a tummy tuck alone. other times the impact will be minimal and the surgeon is just tacking on an extra price.Ive seen plenty of each.Generally a quality cosmetic plastic surgery experience should always begin by first having an accurate assessment which should leave the patient with a clear understanding of exactly why their body looks the way it does especially in comparison to what they wish their body looks like.For example if we limited to just the front of the abdomen there are generally four variables that determine what the abdomen looks like. These are abdominal skin laxity typically due to previous pregnancies, Weight loss or age. The second variable is excess subcutaneous fat (The fat between your skin and muscle layer that you feel when you pinch your skin )especially in an undesirable fat distribution. The third variable is muscle separation from previous pregnancies. The medical term for this is Diastasis rectii. A straight flat abdominal wall should make a B line from your sternum to your pubic bone. The last variable is excess visceral or intra-abdominal fat.Each of these four variables is treated differently.A tummy tuck primarily treats abdominal skin laxity and muscle separation. it will send the subcutaneous fat layer to some degree by pulling the skin and fat layer tight. we can think of this by visualizing a rubber band becomes thin when you pull it tight. so does the skin and the fat layer during a full tummy tuck. The results of the tummy tuck had the greatest influence on the central abdomen. as we get towards the end of the incisions by the hip area there is no longer any impact from the tummy tuck. If there is skin laxity beyond the front of the abdomen that continues over the hips and love handles than an extended tummy tuck is sometimes needed. an extended tummy tuck by definition requires turning the patient during surgery since the limitation of a standard tummy tuck is as far as the surgeon can reach with the patient laying on their back.Excess subcutaneous fat is best treated with Liposuction or weight loss. Excess visceral or intra-abdominal fat can only be reduced with weight loss.Sometimes the flank or love handles waist and back have an undesirable fat distribution that can be impressively improved with well done Liposuction.My experience has been that Liposuction in this area is generally not done as well when its done in combination with a tummy tuck.Ive mentioned previously there are different explanations for this but some of it can simply also be surgeon fatigue after hours of operating doing quality liposuction can be physically exhausting. Quality liposuction also takes time.The best plastic surgeons tend to be meticulous and detail oriented. that type of work simply takes time.To get an accurate assessment of all the areas that are of concern patients should schedule multiple in person consultations.Ideally plastic surgeons should differentiate each of the tissue layers explaining exactly how they are contributing to body form and contour and how each of them can be treated.Before scheduling consultations I recommend patients get a quality said pictures of their tour so taken the same way plastic surgeons take before and after pictures.Generally pictures should be taken by someone else or using the timer on your camera from about 8 feet away. pictures should show your front, side and back side from your shoulders to your knees wearing revealing undergarments with your arms down by your side standing in a neutral relaxed position.I recommend you print a copy of those pictures. start looking at lots of before and after pictures for the procedures youre interested in. When reviewing before and after pictures you should also have the pictures of yourself at hand and select only examples where patients have similar body characteristics to your own in the before pictures. Theres no point of seeing results of individuals who had a different candidacy then your own.If youre interested in getting Liposuction then get familiar with quality Liposuction results look like. If youre interested in a tummy tuck then get an idea of a quality tummy tuck results look like.Next find local board-certified plastic surgeons in your community I seem to have an impressive quantity and quality collection of before and after pictures of the procedure if youre interested on their website.Schedule multiple in person consultations with local providers.Theres no correct number of consultations patients should schedule but the more consultations you schedule the better your chance of finding the best provider.Being board-certified in plastic surgery with an overall good reputation and years of practice does not mean someone has mastered any one single surgical procedure.There are substantial variations in the quality of surgical outcomes based on who does the procedure including well trained experienced board-certified plastic surgeons with a good reputation.During each in person consultation take a note and ask each provider to open up their entire portfolio and before and after pictures of the procedure youre interested.Tell the provider youre only interested in reviewing before and after pictures of the previous patient who have similar body characteristics to your own. have your pictures printed with you and use those when comparing.Bing show me a handful of preselected images representing the best results of a providers career is totally insufficient to get a clear understanding of an average results look like or how many of these procedures any one provider has actually done.For reference and experience provider should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets a before and after pictures of commonly performed procedures like a tummy tuck, abdominal liposuction or a breast lift.Do you need to confirm the surgeons competency for each procedure you are contemplating having.All plastic surgeons will have a variety of outcomes and its fair game for patients to ask to see different types of results.For that reason I recommend patients insist that plastic surgeons show them examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and outcomes that did not turn out as well as they had hoped. ask each surgeon what the revision radius for each of the procedures and what the revision policy is.Look very carefully at results and recognize quality outcomes from your previous reviewing before and after pictures at home.Things to look for include the following.For a full tummy tuck I recommend patients focus on judging results based on who gets the most natural looking belly button on a consistent basis. Its not just the belly button you were looking at but the entire central abdomen. Does it look natural? does it look like a half a dollar sown to a flat abdomen or does it actually look like a normal midsection of an attractive body?The next is a very low set scar. It should preferably in the groin crease or at least within half an inch. The scar should follow anatomic contours naturally and be even on both sides.Finally look at the torso from all angles. Thats the torso looking balanced appropriate and attractive from all angles including from behind?My preference for tummy tuck incisions include a slightly convex curvature over the mons pubis.If you look at before and after pictures on this website youre mostly see the ones posted by providers. these are generally selected as representing better results.You may need to focus more on the patience forms like questions and the answers to get an idea of what tell me a tax of lesser outcomes look like.For Liposuction look very carefully at all areas treated to make sure there are no skin contour irregularities anywhere. review the pictures with the providers and ask the provider to point out exactly what areas were treated and what areas were not treated. look very carefully at transition zones between treated and untreated areas. Quality Liposuction should not be obvious in anyway other than potentially seeing very small incision sites.If Liposuction is part of the recommendation then you need to confirm exactly what areas are being included in their recommendation.You need to have seen sufficient numbers before and after pictures of every single area they are charging you and recommending Liposuction. If youre having liposuction of your back then you need to see results back Liposuction. In regards to Liposuction I view the torso as a single anatomic unit and generally prefer to treat the entire torso in order to leave patient with a natural even in fat distribution without transition zone between treated and untreated areas. This is especially important in individuals who have slightly thicker layers of subcutaneous fat. The thicker the fat layer is the more of a change Liposuction will have in transition zones will stand out and be visible from across the room unless adjacent areas are also treated or the transition zone is blended very carefully. what I refer to as a full torso technically includes upper abdomen, lower abdomen, love handles, waist, full back and under arm area all the way to the side of the breast.Take notes during the consultation and give scores to each of the before and after pictures and always sure that they are a good representative of what your body looks like.Cosmetic surgery results are highly dependent on patient candidacy this is especially true for liposuction.When it comes to breast lift there are different approaches with different scar patterns. there is generally a direct correlation with improved contour and longevity of quality results when longer incisions are part of the design.Surgeons who choose shorter scar versions of a breast lift on individuals who need a more extensive procedure will not deliver the same quality long-term outcome.The type of scar or pattern used for the procedure depends on the degree of droopiness or ptosis of the breast. for some individuals a lollipop scar is sufficient and appropriate. For some a Bonelli or simply a scar around the areola its efficient and for some people they need the full anchor scar.For breast lift procedures its helpful to see long-term follow up when reviewing before and after pictures.The breast will often change over time and especially when the procedure was done with unlimited scar design. Ariolas can become wide and the breast can appear flat after the procedure its not designed correctly.Skin incisions take a long time before they stop changingFor a scar to be fully mature can require 12 to 18 months.Plastic surgeons typically take after pictures during typical follow up appointments which are usually three or six months. even if scheduled follow up appointments at one year or longer are often not followed by patients.For that reason plastic surgeons tend to have more before and after pictures showing early immature scars rather than mature final scars.As welling taking notes regarding the quality and quantity of before and after pictures patient should also take notes about the overall thoroughness of the consultation including all other aspects.This can include medical history review, examination, review of previous procedures and medications, preparation for surgery, recovery after surgery risks and benefits as well as alternative procedures, revision policy and answering questions.I recommend patients avoid scheduling surgery at the time of consultation. Make sure you finished all schedule consultations and think through the process clearly before committing to a permanent and irreversible body changing operation.If you have doubts or reservations and slow down and schedule more consultations.Most people do not have much experience consulting with plastic surgeons. Plastic surgeons on the other hand have lots of experience.Recognize that you are the one paying for the operation and you are the one who is responsible for betting the plastic surgeon and have a right to get confirmatory information regarding the skill and experience of each provider.People typically get better at consulting with more experience and the better you get and the more people you consult with the better your chance of choosing the correct procedure minimizing having a negative experience and maximizing getting a quality outcome representative of what you were shown during consultations when plastic surgeons showed you before and after pictures of the previous patient with similar body characteristics to your own.I recommend patient start by having a minimum of five consultations but consider scheduling many more if needed.There are major offices in outcomes based on who does the procedure. Some surgeons are better at some procedures but not others.Of all the procedures mentioned Liposuction has by far the greatest variation and outcome based on who does the procedure.Liposuction is also the most difficult procedure to improve upon if done poorly during the first operation.This is also true of a tummy tuck to some degree especially if the belly button doesnt look good.Find the right plastic surgeon and everything falls into place.Anybody who chooses to have operations where skin is removed are going to have substantial scars.To get an idea of what your scores will look like look at your own body for previous scars you may have from injuries or procedures.Its over time most scars healed well and are not particularly visible then youll probably heal favorably though you will have scars if you opt for a tummy tuck and the breast lift.Good luck,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Concerned about tummy tuck and lollipop incision scarring after mommy makeover - advice?",/question/kayseri-turkey-scarring-after-mommy-makeover-lollipop-tan
12461130,question,,"Procedures should be chosen based on first having a thorough understanding of what the problem is.This is fairly fundamental and really no different than other types of medical practice. The first step is to make an accurate diagnosis and based on that we can then recommend treatments.And cosmetic procedures we sometimes call a diagnosis an assessment.In regards to the front of your abdomen there are four variables that determine what it looks like.These are skin laxity, excess subcutaneous fat, muscle separation from previous pregnancies and excess visceral or intra-abdominal fat.With some exceptions if someone doesnt like the way their belly looks it is always because of one or more of those four variables.Based on your picture you do not have significant skin laxity. It doesnt look like you have pregnancy related changes nor does it appear that you have an issue with visceral fat.In other words whats keeping your abdomen from looking the best is just excess subcutaneous fat.Considering you dont have skin laxity, you dont have significant muscle separation and no problem with visceral fat you are essentially a perfect Liposuction candidate.I see absolutely no reason why you should have a tummy tuck.Tummy tuck primarily treats skin laxity and muscle separation from previous pregnancies.A tummy tuck is the quintessential operation of her pregnancy related changes.I sometimes describe ideal Liposuction candidates as being young and tight and pudgy.That is basically you.To make a really good quality assessment we should see better pictures. Typically we need to see your entire torso wearing undergarments from your shoulders to your knees showing your front, side and back side.You can crop the pictures below your knees and at your neck.Take a look at how plastic surgeons take before and after pictures to get an idea.Delivering consistent quality liposuction results is more difficult than most people believe.A substantial number of board-certified plastic surgeons with overall good reputation lack the ability to deliver consistent quality liposuction results.Liposuction results are permanent and irreversible. if done poorly patients can be left disfigured. Once someone has had poorly done and Liposuction it is almost impossible to improve on the outcome.For this procedure it is very important that patients shoes as efficiently skilled and talented provider.Like I mentioned earlier being board-certified in plastic surgery with an overall good reputation is not sufficient to confirm someone has mastered this operation.Too many plastic surgeons see Liposuction as a simplistic operation that requires a little or no skill and has a low learning curve.Unfortunately that is not the case and the number of plastic surgeons who can predictably assess accurately and deliver consistent quality results is relatively small.Patients should be vigilant about provider selection for permanent and irreversible body contouring procedures.First and foremost I recommend that you skip choosing providers based on what equipment they use.All plastic surgeons had the equipment they need to deliver quality Liposuction results.What determines if somebody gets a high quality outcome is not what brand equipment they use but simply that they have the skill and experience to do the procedure correctly.There is in reality very little difference between various forms of Liposuction.All of them use very similar small stainless steel canyon less connected to a source of vacuum.Pre-treating the fat with ultrasound as in VASER or with a laser treatment as in smart Lipo changes very little in regards to final outcomes.There is unfortunate spin on the importance of technology primarily due to providers self promoting by claiming their device is superior.It is no different than the idea of choosing a mechanic because of what brand tools they use, buying bread from a bakery based on what brand oven they use, choosing a dentist because of what brand x-ray machine they have.The name of the equipment is irrelevant when it comes to delivering consistent quality liposuction results.If you focus on choosing the right equipment youll miss the boat which is finding the right provider.In the end there are only two variables that determine what liposuction results will look like.They are both about equally as important.The first is patient candidacy and the second is the skill and experience of the provider.Someone who is a poor candidate does not have the potential of getting good results no matter who does the procedure.A patient who is a good candidate like you has the potential of getting good or bad results and that is purely based on who does the operation.Patients do not have much choice in regards to their candidacy with the exception of weight loss for some individuals who are obese. What patients do have is the ability to choose the right provider.To minimize the chance of having an undesirable outcome and making the overall experience of having this procedure a positive one I recommend the following.Start the process by coming familiarized with what quality results look like.Get proper pictures of your own body and print copies of those pictures.Use pictures of your own body whenever reviewing before and after pictures.Choose only results from patients who have similar body characteristics to your own body when looking at results.Look for similar amounts of body fat, similar type of skin, similar age category, similar amount of body fat and overall body shape.Create a reading or grading system for what you consider good results, average results or results that are not impressive. you could use a scale of 1 to 5 for example.Next plan on scheduling multiple in person consultations to board-certified plastic surgeons in your community.Start the process initially by looking at lots of plastic surgeons websites.Look specifically at before and after pictures of Liposuction results counting how many examples they show and what the quality of the results look like.Sometimes providers will include patients who had other procedures under the term liposuction including patients who may have had procedures like a tummy tuck with Liposuction.Those pictures are meaningless unless you plan on also having a tummy tuck which in my opinion you dont need.Once you found a number of providers who seem to have good liposuction experience and results start scheduling in person consultations.I recommend patients avoid the virtual consultations whenever possible and I always recommend people avoid traveling long distances for elective surgical procedures.During each consultation ask each provider to open up their portfolio and show you their entire collection Ill before and after pictures.Providers are most likely going to have a pre-set Collection of results representing the best results of their career.This is not sufficient to get a clear understanding of what average results look like or how many Liposuction cases each provider has actually performed.Instead asked each provider to show you only pictures of previous patients who have similar body characteristics to your own. Bring printed copies of pictures of your torso and use those for reference.Ask the provider to show you examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and outcomes that did not turn out as well as they had hoped for.For reference an experienced surgeon should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures of commonly performed procedures like abdominal liposuction.Being shown a handful of Pictures representing the best result of the providers career is insufficient.Look very carefully at all pictures including all areas that were treated. Make sure there are no skin contour irregularities on any treated area.Ask the provider to go over the pictures with you asking specifically exactly what areas were treated and what areas were not treated.Look carefully at transition zones between treated and untreated areas.Personally I believe the torso as a single anatomic unit and prefer to treat the entire torso when doing Liposuction. doing so lives patience with a natural within even fat distribution thats consistent throughout their entire body without abnormal transitions between treated and untreated areas.Before torso technically includes upper abdomen, lower abdomen, love handles, waist, fullback and under arm area all the way to the side of the breast. some individuals may also include the front row roll, mons pubis and lower back.When receiving a price quote or being told that what areas they recommend treating you need to have reviewed the results on each and every area that you are being sold.For procedures done under general anesthesia its important to ask the surgeon if theyre going to turn your body during surgery.Its very difficult to properly contour the back side with patients laying on their back.To treat the entire torso properly the patient needs to be turned.Personally I do all liposuction with patients awake avoiding general anesthesia.Are using local anesthesia with mild sedation I am able to have patients hold different positions throughout the procedure making it easier to contour the entire body.Plastic surgeons who rely on general anesthesia can certainly still deliver quality results but in my opinion its far easier when avoiding general anesthesia.The type of anesthesia is fairly important and should be discussed during the consultation. I recommend you stay with the type of anesthesia the surgeon recommends.Ask if surgeon what the revision rate is and what the revision policy is.Make notes during the consultation especially giving scores to the quality and quantity of before and after pictures you were shown.You need to keep track and take notes in order to be able to compare different providers over time.You should also take notes about the overall thorough Ness of the consultation regarding other aspects of a plastic surgery consultation including reviewing your medical history, the examination, making an assessment, review of before and after pictures, describing alternative procedures, discussing risks and benefits, preparation for surgery, recovery etc. etc.There is no correct number of consultations patients need to find the right provider.Having only one consultation severely limits you in your ability to choose the best provider.I recommend patients schedule at least five in person consultations and consider scheduling many more before committing to having this procedure.Most people do not have experience consulting with plastic surgeons. Patients need to recognize they are the one hiring the surgeon and you have a right to ask for supporting documentation including sufficient before and after pictures including pictures of different types of outcomes to make an informed decision.Do you are after all paying for the procedure and you should approach the consultation like you are hiring someone which is what you are doing. Youll get better and doing consultations with practice.When in doubt I recommend you slow down the process and schedule more consultations.You should feel very confident that your provider has sufficient skills and experience and has demonstrated this by showing you the collection of before and after pictures that is truly impressive.Highly experienced surgeons will have hundreds or even thousands of before and after pictures for this commonly performed procedure.This needs to be made evident during the consultation. If not then simply continue having more consultations.Once the procedure is performed its very difficult to change the outcome.Liposuction results have more variation based on who does the operation than any other plastic surgery procedure Ive ever seen.Find the right plastic surgeon and everything falls into place.Good luck,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Do I need tummy tuck together with Vaser & does Vaser tighten skin?

11986640,question,,"One way to compare or criticize the outcome of a procedure is to compare it to what an ideal outcome should look like.When I help patients find a plastic surgeon for this procedure I tell him to look for a few classic hallmarks of quality work.The first and most important is critically assessing the plastic surgeons outcomes when it comes to getting a natural looking belly button. Creating a natural appearing belly button is the most difficult part of the procedure and its best done by plastic surgeons who are meticulous and detail oriented.A natural looking Belly button will all have the entire mid abdomen contoured correctly to create the natural funnel shaped scene on the mid abdomen of a normal unadulterated belly..  generally I prefer plastic surgeons who make the belly button itself fairly small and one where the stalk of the belly button helps pull in the abdominal skin towards the muscle wall to create that natural funnel shape.Some belly buttons are easier to work with the others. Typically patients who have deep belly buttons Ive always had a slight advantage compared to those whose belly buttons are shallow.Unfortunately patients who form highly visible scars will have an unnatural appearance regardless of how talented the surgeon was in creating a natural belly button though it certainly helps if the surgeon did not create an excessively large belly button opening on the abdominal skin.The second hallmark or variable to look for is very low sets cars that follow an atomic contours naturally rather than looking like someone was simply cut in half.  The second hallmark or variable to look for is very low sets cars that follow an atomic contours naturally rather than looking like someone was simply cut in half. I personally like the modified Goldwing or W approach where the scar follows the natural curvature of the mons pubis then follows the hip crease all the way out to the side.The length of the incision should be determined by how much skin laxity each individual patient has on the side of the abdomen, waist or even love handles.If skin laxity continues to the backside then so should the skin excision.A talented thoughtful plastic surgeon will consider the entire torso scene from all angles and take this into consideration when designing the procedure. Patients who are reviewing before and after pictures should ask to see what the results look like from the front, side and back side .  If someone has excess fullness and the love handles or hip area that this should be addressed as part of the procedure or else the patient will look like only the front was addressed.For some patience additional Liposuction or extended scars are required to have a desirable contour and appearance from all angles.And looking at your results the belly button lacks finesse and does not appear natural. The scar is that high and does not follow natural contours well. The scar has contour fullness at the end leaving you looking like the procedure wasnt finished towards the hips or back side.In other words your outcome does not have the hallmark signs of a high-quality tummy tuck.Your procedure was not done incorrectly it just wasnt done as well as it could have been by some of the best plastic surgeons I have seen.Major body contouring procedures are kind of a one time deal in that they are fairly permanent and fairly irreversible.I continue to encourage patient to be very selective and making great efforts in finding the most talented and experienced plastic surgeons for their procedures.Surgeon selection is by far the most important variable patients can make.Finding surgeons who deliver consistent high-quality work is more difficult than people think.To do this correctly patients need to schedule exclusively in person consultations and have lots of them. During consultations patients should push their surgeons request seeing their entire collection of before and after pictures.Highly experienced surgeon while have no difficulty showing you 50 or more sense up before and after pictures.Seeing four or five example pictures that in fact represent the very best results of that providers career is insufficient to understand what average results look like.Patients should ask their providers to show examples of their best work, average work unless than results to have a clear understanding of what typical results look like or average results.Seeing the best handful of outcomes over the providers career is insufficient.Patients should look critically at The variables I described previously.I also recommend reading all the reviews on all various physician review websites avoiding providers for any significant number of justified negative reviews.The absence of justified negative reviews is more important and more telling than having an abundance of positive reviews.When a patient meets a plastic surgeon who has an impressive collection of before and after pictures the reads like a telephone book, has virtually no negative reviews and spends enough time to clearly explain the procedure and the potential outcomes in detail and in an honest way they typically know they found their golden ticket. When patients rely on virtual consultations or are only shown a handful of before and after pictures and dont go out to interview multiple providers a chance of ending up with someone who delivers average or mediocre work is far higher. Likewise, ignoring previous patients experiences who have been undesirable should be clear warnings despite providers having positive reviews.Patients are often confused and ill-formed and look for plastic surgeons who are famous, have certain ZIP Codes or are renowned for work unrelated to direct patient care.Famous plastic surgeons are often not particularly talented at surgery but are often above average at self promotion.There are talented providers in almost every community. Often the most talented providers have little online presence, no paid advertising and no social media campaigns.They are typically focused on taking care of their patients and spending time with their family and do not need or desire to engage in self promotion.  Finding the best providers is in someways simply a stroke of luck but the odds are greatly enhanced by having multiple consultations.I dont know if revising your outcome would be justified. Its possible that your incision could be lowered but doing so will inevitably add a new vertical scar representing the current scar around your belly button.Improvements on the sides would be fairly easy but creating a quality result on the front of the abdomen is difficult once the primary procedure has been done.Whether redoing the procedure is justified or not is a discussion that needs to be had through a proper consultation.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: How do my Tummy Tuck results look?

12535640,question,,"There are four variables that determine what someones abdomen looks like. Procedures should be based on first getting a quality assessment and understanding which variables are causing the problem.The four variables that determine what someones abdomen looks like our skin laxity, typically due to previous pregnancies or weight fluctuations, excess subcutaneous fat, muscle separation from previous pregnancies and lastly excess visceral or intra-abdominal fat.In your case you have mild skin laxity, moderate seven cutaneous fat moderate+ muscle separation and potentially may have some visceral fat.A tummy tuck primarily treats abdominal skin laxity and muscle separation. Liposuction will reduce subcutaneous fat. Visceral fat can only be reduced with weight loss.All people will have skin folds on their lower abdomen when they flexed her hips. this is true for everyone including those who have not had previous pregnancies and patients who have had a full tummy tuck. When you sit down youre still going to have folds on your lower abdomen. we dont assess your abdomen based on what the skin looks like when you flex your hips.An assessment is always done based on what your abdomen looks like in a standing position. If you dont have a significant amount of skin laxity than a tummy tuck becomes more of a questionable proposition.Its possible to have a lower set scar even if you dont have significant skin laxity but it may require leaving a small vertical scar where your belly button position was. this small vertical scar will end up somewhere between your new belly button position and the main scar.We sometimes called that not clearing the belly button.Its far better to add the small vertical scar and keep the incision around the belly button small and still have the scar set very low. when you go to interview plastic surgeons look for quality results based on who gets the most natural looking belly buttons with normal looking mid abdomens. Getting the belly button to look normal and natural is one of the harder parts of the procedure and surgeons who get good looking belly buttons consistently tend to be more detail oriented and know what youre doing.The second variable to look for is a very low set scar that follows anatomic contours naturally and evenly on both sides. my personal preference is to make the scar slightly convex over the mons pubis then follow the scar right in the groin crease. The tour so it should look balanced appropriate and attractive from all angles including from behind. for some individuals that means they may need additional liposuction of the love handles and the waist to compensate for the improvement on the front of the abdomen in order to have a balanced appropriate and attractive appearance. For individuals with extensive skin laxity it may require an extended tummy tuck.You should ask yourself how important it is to have a flat tight abdomen?For individuals who dont have significant skin laxity the benefit from the procedure is less than it is for those who have both skin laxity and muscle separation.For reference a tight flat abdomen should create a B line between your sternum and your pubic bone in a standing position.For individuals who may have excess visceral fat does contribute significantly to abdominal bulging. For those individuals they may see improvements with weight loss.If bulging of your abdomen is the primary concern and you dont have significant skin laxity then it becomes more important to differentiate if visceral fat is a component to the bulging or if this is purely due to just muscle separation.Muscle separation and excess visceral fat camp present similarly.If you can reduce visceral fat and get a flatter abdomen from weight loss then that may be sufficient to warrant not having the procedure.In the end it depends on what youre trying to achieve and what youre willing to go through.A full tummy tuck in your case the procedure will interfere with your tattoo slightly. your upper abdominal tattoo will be brought down by at least 4 to 6 inches. your belly button will go through the tattoo. This may be one more reason to consider not doing the tummy tuck. It may be possible to bring out the belly button through non-inked skin and still have your tattoo look intact. you should discuss this during in person consultations.Full torso liposuction is an alternative procedure. It will not directly address muscle separation but can bring in the front of your abdomen by about an inch. delivering consistent quality liposuction results is more difficult than most people believe and patients should be very selective in choosing providers for both Liposuction and a full tummy tuck. Of those two procedures I see more variation and liposuction results than any other plastic surgery procedure.Liposuction in particular is highly surgeon dependent in regards to making an accurate assessment and delivering consistent quality results without disfigurement.I recommend having multiple in person consultations with local board-certified plastic surgeons in your community.You will probably find the plastic surgeons who have not mastered liposuction will push and recommend only having a tummy tuck. Surgeons for a very skilled at Liposuction will probably be more likely to be open to either Liposuction or a tummy tuck as a reasonable procedures.When it comes to Liposuction I personally view the torso as a single anatomic unit and usually try to treat the entire torso if Im going to do liposuction.Buy treating the entire torso as a single anatomic unit patience I left with an even thin fat distribution without transition zone between treated and on treated areas.Regardless of what procedure you choose you should properly vet plastic surgeons during in person consultations.Start by bringing pictures of your own torso taken the same way plastic surgeons take before and after pictures. stand up straight and take the picture from about 8 feet away using the timer on your camera or have someone else take the picture. The picture should include your body from your shoulders to your knees showing your front side, side and backside.Bring printed copies of pictures of yourself with you and use as a reference during consultations.Ask each provider to open up their portfolio and show you their entire collection of before and after pictures for whatever procedure you are considering it with that provider.Providers may be apprehensive to show you all of the results and will instead encourage you to look at preselected best of their career outcomes. well these may be impressive and nice to look at seeing only the providers best results does not give you a good idea of what average results look like or how many of these procedures they have actually performed.For that reason I recommend that you ask providers to only show you pictures of previous patients who are very similar body characteristics to your own.As efficiently skills and experience provider should have hundreds or even thousands of before and after pictures to choose from.It should not be difficult for them to find previous patients who had similar body characteristics to your own.Ask providers to show you examples of excellent outcomes, average outcomes and outcomes that did not turn out as well as they had hoped for. we all have a variety of outcomes and its fair game for patients to ask to see them.Again, providers may want to stick to showing you only their best results based on preselected images.For reference and experience Sergeant should have no difficulty showing you at least 50 sets of before and after pictures of commonly performed procedures like a full tummy tuck or abdominal liposuction.Look carefully at pictures and scrutinize them.For Liposuction it look very carefully to make sure there are no skin contour irregularities in any treated area. as providers to explain exactly what areas were treated and what areas were not treated with liposuction. look carefully at transition zones between treated and untreated areas to make sure they look completely natural and are attractive.Ive already reviewed how you assess tummy tuck results.Theres no correct number of consultations someone should have it to find the best provider. I personally recommend starting with a minimum of five in person consultations and considering scheduling many more unless you feel very confident you found the best provider.I cannot emphasize enough the importance of finding the best provider and acknowledging there is a significant difference in average outcomes depending on who does the procedure.Simply being board-certified and plastic surgery with years of experience and an overall good reputation is not sufficient to confirm someone has mastered anyone procedure. this is especially true when it comes to Liposuction.When in doubt slow down and schedule more consultations.Best,Mats Hagstrom MD","Mats Hagstrom, MD answers: Am I a tummy tuck candidate?

457228,question,,"	How much does a tummy tuck cost.	The cost depends on what the patient needs and how much time is required. When I do a tummy tuck I do what I think helps to get the best and longest-lasting results for my patients. In my practice a tummy tuck that takes between 4.5 and 7.5 hours of operating room time, depending on what is done is in the broad range of 11-15,000. But I am sure you can also find a tummy tuck for 7-9,000 in some areas, and more in others. If breast surgery is part of the procedure, it will cost more. Each patient is individualized according to their needs. These costs are inclusive of my fee, anesthesia, facility charges, Exparel, Prineo dermabond,Cosmetassure insurance, and follow-up care.	This is what is involved in a tummy tuck.	If the patient has extra thickness of fat of the abdomen and waist or flanks, the tummy tuck starts with infiltration of all these tissue layers with tumescent salt solution followed by treatment with vaser ultrasonic liposuction.	I do not consider a patient with excess fat of the abdomen or waist to have had a proper tummy tuck without treating all these areas. At the end of the procedure I want the patient to have a sculpted, natural look. I try to bring out the underlying shape of the waist and hips.I find the best results come from tailoring the flap to the exact amount of skin to be removed. Therefore I do not predetermine where the upper incision for skin removal will be until all the other work is completed.	All tummy tucks are individualized, but all include careful elevation of the upper abdominal flap in a way that preserves the maximum blood supply to the skin that must join the lower incision. This is usually referred to as a tunnel from belly button to lower tip of breast bone. Undermining is limited to just the width needed to bring the rectus muscle together. Some doctors undermine all the way up to the rib margin and lose this blood supply. This takes less time but makes it easier to bring the flap down for closure without having to use other techniques such as discontinuous undermining and more flexing of the table to relieve tension.	If there is any excess fat after remaining after elevating the upper flap, it is carefully trimmed at the appropriate level from below. The margins of the flap, particularly laterally, are carefully tapered and trimmed to fit nicely with the thinner skin of the anterior thigh and hip below the incision. If not already removed, the lower abdominal skin is then removed.Exparel, long-acting bupivicaine anesthetic is then injected under the rectus and external oblique fascia. It gives a slow release of anesthetic over a three day period, and makes my patients much more comfortable in the recovery room and during the next day or two. Although it does not relieve all pain, it reduces the amount of painand theneed for narcotic pain medication after surgery.	The next step is a multiple-layer closure of the rectus muscle in the midline. This is done along the entire length of the rectus, not just above and below the belly button. I prefer multiple figure-of-eight sutures of permanent suture, followed by a double row of slowly dissolving Quill sutures. I take care to go all the way up, and all the way down to the pubic bone to avoid unsightly bulges in the upper and/or lower abdomen. I sit the patient up to see if there are any areas of bulging or laxity that would be hidden with the patient lying down. This helps prevent surprises later when an upper or lower abdominal bulge could become apparent.	I next trim the flap to precisely fit the lower incision without dog ears. I use the Lockwood flap marker to ensure that no extra skin is left behind.	I then determine the umbilical location with the flap temporarily closed with atraumatic clamps to set the tension properly before measuring where to place the belly button. I always place the umbilicus at a distance from the pubic incision that is normal, depending on patient height and pre-existing height of their belly button. Nothing is more unattractive than a high incision and a low belly button relative to the incision.The most attractive belly button appears to be vertical with a hood, according to patient surveys.When the opening is made to receive the belly button, a small flap is left superiorly to have enough skin to fold over and make a hood. Also when the belly button is outlined at the beginning of the procedure, it is left 3 cm in length to make sure there is enough tissue present to get some depth.	The elevated abdominal skin is re-connected to the abdominal wall with progressive tension sutures above the belly button andspecial Quill quilting sutures.This is a recent technological innovation that allows the skin to be progressively snugged up, top to bottom, without needing individual sutures or knots.The entire open space of flap elevation is closed off. This means no drains are necessary and none are used. I have used a drainless technique for many years and have not had any seroma problems.	The incision closure takesup toan hourand is done to last a lifetime and minimize the chance of any unfavorable scarring. My goal is to have a secure closure that will heal as a fine pencil line after the redness fades. There are two separate suture layers. The deeperlayer is a slowly dissolving Quill suture that grasps the deep layer of the flap that can hold tension without having tension on the skin surface. The edges of the incision are brought together in such a way that when the superficial layer is closed with a finer absorbable suture, the appearance is of a little hill. This means that at the skin level there is no tension. As the tissues relax over the next two months, the hill becomes flat and the scar has the best chance to heal as a fine line.	First, the central two-thirds are closed with a deep layer vertical runningsuture placed close enough togetherthat a finger cannot be placed between them. This creates the high-lateral tension that distributes the tension more to the groin area than the midline. This decreases the possibility that there will be any excess tension in the pubic area that can lead to wound healing problems or unnatural elevation of the mons. The closure is very secure and allows a sleek distribution of tension across the front of the thigh to the abdomen. This gives a lift to the anterior thigh as well, eliminating pre-operative sagginess. The suture continues to the end in horizontal fashion as the flaps are thinner laterally.	The outerlayer is a Quill suture that brings together the skin edges so they are just kissing. Since there is now no tension now on the layer of the skin that forms the visible scar, the most favorable conditions have been created for a hairline, flat scar. Thisfinal layer is a dissolvingabsorbable suture that brings the skin together as finely as in a facelift.	The belly button closure is finalized by a deep layer of dermal sutures for strength and multiple individual half-buried mattress sutures of nylon that very precisely line up the umbilical skin with the abdominal skin with no sutures passing through the abdominal skin side and all knots on the belly button side. These sutures can be left in for two weeks for excellent healing without leaving any visible suture marks.	I cover the incision with a layer of Prineo dermabond tape. This is a flexible woven tape that is coveredwith a polymer adhesive. It is removed at threeweeks. Some gauze and a Topifoam sponge is applied and held in place with a binder. The abdomen and flanks are covered with Topifoam sponge which greatly reduces bruising in any place where there has been liposuction.There are no pain pump or other catheters because we have used Exparel for local anesthetic pain control, and no suction drains are needed since we have closed off the space with quilting sutures.	As you can see, the tummy tuck described above is atechnical and refined operation. It deserves the time required in my hands to achieve the goal that patients want: a youthful, slim figure, a low, hidden incision, an attractive belly button, no drains and removal of excess fat.","Robert M.
